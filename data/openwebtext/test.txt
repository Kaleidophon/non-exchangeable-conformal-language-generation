Clements found this to be criminal harassment. During sentencing submissions, Crown prosecutor Derek Ishak described Brazau as an “unrepentant hatemonger … who abused his right to freedom of speech in a planned, deliberate manner,” Clements said Tuesday in his sentencing decision. However, Clements said that while Brazau’s conduct was “despicable” and his beliefs “repugnant,” the maximum sentence of six months for a summary conviction on willfully promoting hatred was unwarranted. He also noted the defence submission that Brazau committed his offences in public, where he was easily identifiable, rather than by stealth. Instead, he gave Brazau a four-month sentence, plus two months for criminal harassment and mischief and three months for breach of probation by not keeping the peace. Brazau, who had spent nine months in pre-trial custody, was sentenced to time served. Clements declined to ban Brazau from distributing flyers, since that could impede his right to freedom of expression. Outside the court, Brazau said he will appeal his sentence. He says he is aware the flyer was “problematic” and “would offend.” But his voice won’t be silenced, Brazau added, though he will keep in mind the hate speech laws, which he says he has learned to navigate over the past few months. “Hatred is the harvest he wanted to gather,” Clements said in his conviction decision, quoting William Butler Yeats. “I find this is true of Mr. Brazau.” Last month, a small claims court found that Brazau had been wrongfully arrested and detained while protesting near Sgt. Ryan Russell’s funeral procession in 2011. However, the deputy judge also found his conduct “reprehensible” and awarded him only $1,000 in damages.The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.
So go ahead and cry us a river about how the conservative media are mistreating you, Mr. Obama, and misleading the public. You have been trying to deceive us for eight years, and the public has been onto you for at least 6 1/2 of those years. Now voters have handed you your biggest spanking yet, and you still will not listen. You can't listen. It's not what you do. But the American people have been listening, and they do understand your policies. And it's a new day in America.What is the cure for American health care? That is a question that a lot of people are trying to answer, and it’s a highly debated topic, but the answer is plain and simple. Single payer health care is the best form of health care a nation can hope to have. It is efficient, provides quality and timely access to everyone, and it is cost effective. A single payer health care system is a system in which the government, rather than private insurers, pays for all health costs. The system is funded typically through income taxes and is free at the point of use. Some countries with a single payer system include Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, and Australia. France is often considered to have the best health care system in the world, but a large group of people (including myself) believe the best system is the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS). This is because of its central and efficient operation, as well as high quality standards, low wait times, and staff quality.
This is just one example of the several studies on this issue all saying the same thing, that single payer works and it is inherently the best system a nation could hope to have. A study by the World Health Organization also supports this claim and in a world-wide health care ranking, the United States was ranked 37, Canada was 32, the UK ranked 7, and France number 1. All of the countries ahead of the United States had a form of universal coverage and all of the countries in the top 25 had a single payer system. The OECD (The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) performed a study on wait times and found that the wait times in the United States increased by 30% in major U.S. cities, and that the U.S. had above average wait times. However, the U.K. and France were below the average wait times and were in the top five worldwide, both operating under a single payer system. Another organization, based in the United States, that has been pushing for single payer and has also conducted multiple studies is the PNHP (Physicians for a National Health Program), an organization of thousands of doctors, nurses, and health specialists. PNHP has been supporting and proposing legislation at the state and federal level for years, gaining little ground. A large reason is health insurance company money in politics, and “corporate” arguments propped up, in large part, by the republican party.
If Team B wishes to buy Team A’s player C, then B must first approach A and confirm whether the player is available for transfer. If A agrees, only then is B allowed to approach the player C. If player C is open and willing, then Team B can lay out their transfer conditions and offer. If player C does not agree to these terms, then he will remain at his current club; if player C agrees, then all three parties, A, B, and C need to communicate with ACE via email and receive their confirmation. In the ensuing days, the involved parties need to come to the ACE offices in order to sort out paperwork and related processes, and then they are allowed to make official announcements regarding the news. If the new team and their new player decides to use existing contracts, then they perform a trade of contracts while at ACE. If they decide to sign a new contract, then the new contract will be signed and backup files stored with ACE. In the case later on that a party fails to uphold their end of a contract, then ACE will be abe to lay penalties according to existing policies.
It is difficult to overstate how uncontroversial it is in the field of labor market policy evaluation to assert the superiority of matching methods to the nonmatching approaches described above. The seminal evaluations of the effects of job training programs, work-sharing arrangements, employment tax credits, educational interventions, and housing vouchers all use at least some sort of matching method, if not an actual randomized experiment. In their widely cited survey article on non-experimental evaluation, Blundell and Costa Dias (2000) do not even mention state-level fixed-effects models when they list the five major categories of evaluation methods. In a similar article, Imbens and Wooldridge (2009) do mention fixed-effects models as a tool for policy evaluation, but clarify that these were used before more advanced methods were developed, noting that the modern use of fixed-effects models is typically in combination with other more sophisticated techniques. For example, Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010) also use a fixed-effects model, but more importantly it is a fixed-effects model that utilizes rigorous matching strategy to identify the effect of the minimum wage. Sometimes fixed-effects models are the best available option if no natural experiment or other matching opportunity emerges to provide a more rigorous approach. Well specified fixed-effects models can still be informative. But faced with the choice between a well matched comparison group and a fixed-effects model, the former is unambiguously the stronger study design.
In the immediate aftermath of the Card and Krueger (1994) study, many critics simply dismissed the finding as an abandonment of sound economic theory. Fortunately, today these reactions are less common (though still not unheard of), and the major voices in the discussion seem to be developing a mutual appreciation for the importance of hammering out credible study designs. An excellent example is the recent exchange between Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013) and Allegretto et al. (2013). Instead of advancing new work in the tradition of a state-level fixed-effects model, Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013) raise criticisms of the county matching approach of Dube and his colleagues, and then go on to offer an alternative matching approach that they feel to be more appropriate. They suggest that a better method is the “synthetic control” approach of Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), which generates weights for a number of comparison cases that together provide a good match to the treatment case. After running models using the synthetic control method, Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013) find evidence for negative effects of a higher minimum wage on employment, consistent with their work with state-level fixed-effects models. Allegretto et al. (2013) responded by defending their county-pair approach and further developing the synthetic control method, including rectifying problems in Neumark, Salas, and Wascher’s (2013) work. In a separate paper, Dube and Zipperer (2013) argue that Neumark, Salas, and Wascher (2013) fail to properly implement the synthetic control method, using an approach that is quite different from the earlier literature in that tradition and much less defensible. Allegretto et al. (2013) and Dube and Zipperer (2013) conclude that across both methods (their contiguous county approach and a properly executed synthetic control method), the minimum wage does not have substantial disemployment effects.
Supergirl : With her new-found super-hearing, Supergirl's overwhelmed by deafening random noises and sounds from around the globe (bottom of page 14) including quotes we've seen spoken in Nightwing, Aquaman , and Birds of Prey . Nightwing is set in Gotham under night-dark skies, and there's storm lightning in the sky. Aquaman is in a Boston seafood restaurant at sunset. It's a rainy night in Gotham City when Starling quips about being damned in Birds of Prey . It's dawn in Russia, as the rising sun fuels Kara's superpowers. That scene in Gotham City (long set in DC history as located on the East Coast) can't be pure night at the same time it's sunset in Boston, but it could be a very dark dusk exaggerated by the pouring rain on the Birds of Prey's side of town and the fast-approaching storm around Nightwing. If this is the case, then whether by intent or design, this timing is all absolutely accurate . Many timezones encompass Siberia including twelve hours after East Coast time. In other words, dusk on the US's east coast equals dawn in parts of Siberia. That's the kind of cool synchronicity that makes me love shared-universe fiction, whether the creators planned this or not. (And oh, yes, the Red-Hooded Woman is there, too.)
During this time I referred him to a manager, Jason Karpel, of Elite Management. I told Lowen that he would need a manager because "I know you will blow up and these guys can help you get more sponsorship money and into the big shows". At this point, Lowen is going into his 2nd OneFC fight against Felipe Enomoto making $2500 to show, $2500 to win, with a finish bonus of a $1250 and a 20% increase off the whole sum for every win. Lowen wins and purse totals $6250. I told Lowen that I have taken him as far as I could and at the next level he would need a manager. So Jason Karpel talks with Lowen and his father, Myles, and begins to work on Lowen’s behalf in good faith that Lowen will sign with Jason Karpel. Karpel then went on to get Lowen sponsored by Jaco Clothing and some other main sponsors. I was able to land him a local sponsor (Pound 4 Pound), which paid for Lowen’s gym membership as well as travel money when he fought. Lowen VERBALLY agreed to sign with Karpel. He ended up NOT signing with Karpel after he already received sponsorship and gear for his first OneFC fight. It was 9 months later and well into both contracts that Lowen finally signs with Karpel.
Federal investment in this research (although it predated the 2008 election) became closely tied to the Obama administration’s health-care reform agenda, because big funding increases were tucked into the 2009 stimulus legislation and the Affordable Care Act — two measures the GOP strongly opposed. An increased federal role in comparative effectiveness research, together with payments to physicians for voluntary counseling to Medicare patients about end-of-life options and the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (another agency the GOP wishes to kill) contributed to the “death panels” myth, which Republicans have used to frame health-care reform as “rationing.” As University of Maryland political scientist Frances E. Lee argues, partisan conflict over technocratic issues such as medical research is often “opportunistic and focused on electoral advantage.” As she writes, “The politics of good government, ironically, is hardball.” Although evidence-based medicine might seem likely to have bipartisan support, it has become a partisan issue among voters. In 2010, Alan Gerber, David Doherty, Conor Dowling and I conducted a national survey to gauge public support for government funding of research on the effectiveness of treatments. Among those who reported not voting in 2008, there was not a large difference in support across Democrats and Republicans, but there were significant partisan differences among voters. Republican voters were much less supportive than Democrats. During the debates over the stimulus bill and health-care reform, the two parties took opposing stands on the federal government’s role in this effort, which led to the significant partisan split among politically engaged citizens. Research on the effectiveness of different treatments is a threat to the incomes of some health industry stakeholders. In 1994, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (the precursor to AHRQ) issued a report concluding that there was little evidence to support back surgery over nonsurgical alternatives for many cases of lower-back pain. Back surgeons went ballistic, and successfully lobbied Republicans in Congress (who associated the agency with the Clinton health-care reform plan) to slash the agency’s budget and curb its authority. Although some health IT companies see the value of AHRQ and PCORI, there are powerful interest groups that wouldn’t mind if the agencies were weakened. The public is not engaged. Although patients, caregivers, and family members would benefit from better information about the effectiveness of treatments, the benefits of a stronger base of medical evidence are too diffuse to mobilize ordinary citizens. AHRQ and PCORI are public-interest agencies that lack a natural constituency. Republicans have attacked government funding of evidence-based medicine research because there is little political penalty to doing so. The penalty would be higher if Republicans feared getting on the wrong side of doctors. In our survey research, we found that when it comes to the role of evidence in patient decisions as well as in the allocation of health-care money, the public believes that “doctors know best.” The public views doctors as trusted agents of their interests; when respondents are told that doctors support government funding of evidence-based medicine research, the argument of opponents that study findings will be used as a pretext for rationing loses its sting.
It turns out that the reason Quiet wears that bikini outfit is because of a parasitic infection. This infection means that she has to breathe through her skin, using photosynthesis to absorb air, water, and nutrients. So, you see, Quiet doesn’t want to be exposed in the way she is. She has to be. And that’s empowering how exactly? She’s essentially a houseplant. Quiet is actually the second photosynthetic character in the series, the previous character being The End, but for some reason he gets to wear a lot more clothes than Quiet does. Probably his lack of displayable tits.No. 1 - Retired for Billy Martin Earle Combs 1929-1935 George Selkirk 1934 Roy Johnson 1936 Frank Crosetti 1937-1944 Tuck Stainback 1944 George Stirnweiss 1945-1950 BILLY MARTIN 1951-1957 Bobby Richardson 1958-1966 Bobby Murcer 1969-1974 No. 2 Mark Koenig 1929-1930 Yats Yuestling 1930 Joe Sewell 1931 Lyn Lary 1931-1934 Red Rolfe 1931, 1934-1942 George Stirnweiss 1943-1944 Frank Crosetti 1945-1966 Jerry Kenny 1969-1972 Matty Alou 1973 Sandy Alomar 1974-1976 Paul Blair 1977-1979 Darryl Jones 1979 Bobby Murcer 1979-1983 Tim Foli 1984 Dale Berra 1985 Wayne Tolleson 1986-1990 Mike Gallego 1992-1994 Derek Jeter 1995-2003 No. 3 - Retired For Babe Ruth BABE RUTH 1920-1934 George Selkirk 1935-1942 Bud Methany 1943-1946 Roy Weatherly 1946 Hal Peck** 1946 Eddie Bockman 1946 Joe Medwick** 1947 Frank Colman 1947 Allie Clark 1947 Cliff Mapes 1948 *With the Yankees for 10 days, never appeared in a game.

Last week, I incorrectly predicted Millenium, Roccat, Dignitas, and Alliance. My data incorrectly predicted Roccat, Dignitas, CLG, and Gambit. I made the mistake of thinking that Mil was on a downswing, when in reality they were just being horribly inconsistent which they showed in their crushing victory over Alliance and their close game with CW. Alliance was the exact opposite: I thought that they were just having a fluke week on super week and that their games vs Roccat and Millenium would boost them back up. Instead, they went 0-2 and look extremely vulnerable for the first time this season. It seemed expected that Dig would at least have close games with LMQ and CLG, but they were crushed in both games and garnered less than half of what was expected of them. Roccat went 2-0 against SK and Alliance. CLG went 2-0 against TSM and Dig in crushing victories. Gambit swapped their roster around and not even NiQ could post a decent score this week. SK did much worse than expected this week, however, they were expected to do the worst, or the 2nd worst in each of their respective positions, so I would say that was still accurate.
(for PC): While it's a decent bookmarking alternative, I dislike the layout and navigation. I'm disappointed that I can't import it into Edge, but it's understandable considering the circumstances. What I found insulting and misleading was the solution: open each link in Edge, one by one, save. It is the solution but it was poorly executed. Moving on, Importing the links as favorites and then manually/optionally saving it within the browser is clearly a better alternative. Ideally, I'd use Reading List as my default bookmarking as it appears to sync seamlessly. Edge is rather limited at this early stage of development. On that note, backing up and exporting favorites in Edge would be nice. (WP8.1) I like using this app on my phone. One request: Disable saving duplicates, if possible. Thank you. via WP10: When I wiped my PC's hard drive I assumed I'd lose my favorites saved to Edge. I was wrong. Importing Reading List into Edge also changed awhile ago. Thank you very much.Most Russians acknowledge that the country is facing a potentially lengthy economic crisis, but at the same time don’t expect to suffer any personal consequences such as redundancy or delays in salary payment in the near future as a result.
But that also makes the Czech government a potential ally for Mr Cameron, who is not looking quite so isolated on this issue as some might aver. Softly, softly, "Europe" is going his way. He may well confound Juncker, and bring home his treaty, sufficient for him to call upon the British to renew their wedding vows. Jean-Claude Juncker says he is prepared to examine the UK's demands on how the EU should change – or so we are told by Bloomberg . but there is a: he will not allow certain "red lines", including on immigration issues, to be crossed.But what grabs the headline is the Commission President comparing EU-UK relations to a love affair. "It's easy to fall in love and more difficult to stay together", Juncker says, also observing that, "people shouldn't stay together if the conditions aren't the same as when things started".That, of course, is horse manure: conditions always change, so the test is whether people can adapt to them. In the case of the EU though, which – at best – was a loveless, arranged marriage, there never was a situation when we should have stayed together.Nevertheless, while Juncker still feels that, "it's in the interest of both the UK and the EU to stay together", he reaffirms that he won't weaken the EU's fundamental principles."When one mentions the end of the free circulation of workers, there can be no debate, dialogue or compromise", he says. "We can fight against abuses - and national lawmakers can do that - but the EU lawmakers won't change the treaties to satisfy the will of certain politicians".So, it seems, Juncker is still playing the "bad cop" against Merkel's "good cop", although he's not saying anything very new.Interestingly, though, Mr Cameron could be acquiring another ally, in Hungary's prime minister . Yesterday, he was urging the EU to limit immigration, saying that some people were abusing the asylum rules, when they were actually seeking employment.This is Viktor Orban, who says he believes the EU's laws on asylum should be tightened, just a week after he said in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris that immigration into Europe should stop – with not an EU flag in sight (pictured)."This is a Christian country", he said on a Sunday radio talk show. "We can help those who are indeed chased out of their countries, but we have to make it clear we don’t want to be the destination for immigrants seeking to make a living here".The number seeking asylum last year in Hungary was 43,000 last year, double the figure in 2013, Mr. Orban says, a large number in relation to Hungary's total population of a little below ten million."If Europe continues to bury its head in the sand, these trends won't change. It now seems like Brussels won't shield us from this issue; we have to protect ourselves", Orban adds, then saying that the Dublin Regulation should be upheld, so that those immigrants who manage to escape farther westward within the EU can be transported back to the country where they entered the EU.Hungary is perhaps not the best of allies though. It gets asylum seekers routed through its territory from Greece and Bulgaria, most often via Serbia, where there were 19,951 illegal crossings in 2013, up 212 percent on the previous year. But in Hungary, though – as the German broadcaster Spiegel reported in September 2014, there is no functioning asylum system. Illegal detention is routine and guards use drugs to sedate migrants.The few existing facilities are overflowing, so that many refugees are housed in former military barracks or community buildings converted into prisons for migrants. In April 2014, more than 40 percent of all male asylum seekers were being housed in a prison. The reasons for arrest were arbitrary and unclear. As a rule, migrants were held for a month without having committed a crime.The UNHCR has been critical of conditions in the asylum prisons, calling them "inhumane and demeaning".Detainees remained behind bars typically for four to five months, while some for the entire length of their asylum procedure. They were locked in their cells much of the day, suffered verbal and physical abuse by the security guards, and were escorted in handcuffs and on leashes to the court hearings or even to doctors, treated like a criminal.Hungarian authorities often automatically started the aliens police procedure and ordered detention of asylum-seekers. Courts tended to review detention orders in group hearings, dealing with the case of 5-10 people in 30 minutes that was not enough time properly to consider the facts of each individual case.According to UNHCR, asylum-seekers were also routinely deported to Serbia, considered by Hungary as a safe third country. In Serbia, however, asylum-seekers faced chain deportations to Macedonia and Greece, countries with no adequate asylum systems in place, and where asylum-seekers faced the risk ofto countries where they may have fled danger or persecution.However, resistance to the flow of asylum seekers is also manifest in the Czech Republic where, on Friday, hundreds showed up for a rally in which protesters objected to allowing Muslims to settle in Central Europe (even after this Monday's Pegida rally had been cancelled.The centre-left Czech government has so far been reluctant to offer asylum to refugees from the Middle East because of concerns that potential terrorists might be among them. It eventually agreed to take in 70 Syrian refugees under EU pressure, against thousands presenting themselves to the rest of the EU.But that also makes the Czech government a potential ally for Mr Cameron, who is not looking quite so isolated on this issue as some might aver. Softly, softly, "Europe" is going his way. He may well confound Juncker, and bring home his treaty, sufficient for him to call upon the British to renew their wedding vows.
The first practical intelligence test was developed between 1905 and 1908 by Alfred Binet in France for school placement of children. Binet warned that results from his test should not be assumed to measure innate intelligence or used to label individuals permanently. Binet's test was translated into English and revised in 1916 by Lewis Terman (who introduced IQ scoring for the test results) and published under the name the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales. As Terman's test was published, there was great concern in the United States about the abilities and skills of recent immigrants. Different immigrant nationalities were sometimes thought to belong to different races, such as Slavs. A different set of tests developed by Robert Yerkes were used to evaluate draftees for World War I, and researchers found that people from southern and eastern Europe scored lower than native-born Americans, that Americans from northern states had higher scores than Americans from southern states, and that black Americans scored lower than white Americans. The results were widely publicized by a lobby of anti-immigration activists, including the New York patrician and conservationist Madison Grant, who considered the Nordic race to be superior, but under threat of immigration by inferior breeds. In his influential work A Study of American Intelligence psychologist Carl Brigham used the results of the Army tests to argue for a stricter immigration policy, limiting immigration to countries considered to belong to the "nordic race".
In the 1920s, states like Virginia enacted eugenic laws, such as its 1924 Racial Integrity Act, which established the one-drop rule as law. On the other hand, many scientists reacted to eugenicist claims linking abilities and moral character to racial or genetic ancestry. They pointed to the contribution of environment to test results (such as speaking English as a second language). By the mid-1930s, many United States psychologists adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors played a dominant role in IQ test results, among them Carl Brigham who repudiated his own previous arguments, on the grounds that he realized that the tests were not a measure of innate intelligence. Discussion of the issue in the United States also influenced German Nazi claims of the "nordics" being a "master race", influenced by Grant's writings. As the American public sentiment shifted against the Germans, claims of racial differences in intelligence increasingly came to be regarded as problematic.[7] Anthropologists such as Franz Boas, and Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish, did much to demonstrate the unscientific status of many of the claims about racial hierarchies of intelligence. Nonetheless a powerful eugenics and segregation lobby funded largely by textile-magnate Wickliffe Draper, continued to publicize studies using intelligence studies as an argument for eugenics, segregation, and anti-immigration legislation.
In relation to the study of racial differences in IQ test scores it becomes a crucial question what exactly it is that IQ tests measure. Arthur Jensen was a proponent of the view that there is a correlation between scores on all the known types of IQ tests and that this correlation points to an underlying factor of general intelligence, or g. In most conceptions of g it is considered to be fairly fixed in a given individual and unresponsive to training or other environmental influences. In this view test score differences, especially in those tasks considered to be particularly "g-loaded" reflect the test takers innate capability. Other psychometricians argue that, while there may or may not be a general intelligence factor, performance on tests rely crucially on knowledge acquired through prior exposure to the types of tasks that such tests contain. This view would mean that tests cannot be expected to reflect only the innate abilities of a given individual, because the expression of potential will always be mediated by experience and cognitive habits. It also means that comparison of test scores from persons with widely different life experiences and cognitive habits is not an expression of their relative innate potentials.
Rushton & Jensen (2005) wrote that, in the United States, self-identified blacks and whites have been the subjects of the greatest number of studies. They stated that the black-white IQ difference is about 15 to 18 points or 1 to 1.1 standard deviations (SDs), which implies that between 11 and 16 percent of the black population have an IQ above 100 (the general population median). According to Arthur Jensen and J. Philippe Rushton the black-white IQ difference is largest on those components of IQ tests that are claimed best to represent the general intelligence factor g.[47] The 1996 APA report "Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns" and the 1994 editorial statement "Mainstream Science on Intelligence" gave more or less similar estimates.[48][49] Roth et al. (2001), in a review of the results of a total of 6,246,729 participants on other tests of cognitive ability or aptitude, found a difference in mean IQ scores between blacks and whites of 1.1 SD. Consistent results were found for college and university application tests such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (N = 2.4 million) and Graduate Record Examination (N = 2.3 million), as well as for tests of job applicants in corporate sections (N = 0.5 million) and in the military (N = 0.4 million).[50]
In the 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, and IQ and Global Inequality in 2006, Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen created estimates of average IQs for 113 nations. They estimated IQs of 79 other nations based on neighboring nations or via other means. They saw a consistent correlation between national development and national IQ averages. They found the highest national IQs among Western and East Asian developed nations and the lowest national IQs in the world's least developed nations among the indigenous peoples in the regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.[56] In a meta-analysis of studies of IQ estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wicherts, Dolan & van der Maas (2009, p. 10) concluded that Lynn and Vanhanen had relied on unsystematic methodology by failing to publish their criteria for including or excluding studies. They found that Lynn and Vanhanen's exclusion of studies had depressed their IQ estimate for sub-Saharan Africa, and that including studies excluded in "IQ and Global Inequality" resulted in average IQ of 82 for sub-Saharan Africa, lower than the average in Western countries, but higher than Lynn and Vanhanen's estimate of 67. Wicherts at al. conclude that this difference is likely due to sub-Saharan Africa having limited access to modern advances in education, nutrition and health care.
A separate phenomenon from the Flynn effect has been the discovery that the IQ gap has been gradually closing over the last decades of the 20th century, as black test-takers increased their average scores relative to white test-takers. For instance, Vincent reported in 1991 that the black-white IQ gap was decreasing among children, but that it was remaining constant among adults. Similarly, a 2006 study by Dickens and Flynn estimated that the difference between mean scores of blacks and whites closed by about 5 or 6 IQ points between 1972 and 2002, a reduction of about one-third. In the same period, the educational achievement disparity also diminished.[68] However, this was challenged by Rushton & Jensen who claim the difference remains stable. In a 2006 study, Murray agreed with Dickens and Flynn that there has been a narrowing of the difference; "Dickens' and Flynn's estimate of 3–6 IQ points from a base of about 16–18 points is a useful, though provisional, starting point". But he argued that this has stalled and that there has been no further narrowing for people born after the late 1970s. A subsequent study by Murray, based on the Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, estimated that the black-white IQ difference decreased by about one-half of one standard deviation from those born in the 1920s to those born in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s. Recent reviews by Flynn and Dickens (2006), Mackintosh (2011), and Nisbett et al. 2012 accept the gradual closing of the gap as a fact. In his review of the historical trends, Hunt (2010, p. 411) states: "There is some variety in the results, but not a great deal. The African American means are about 1 standard deviation unit (15 points on the IQ scale) below the white means, and the Hispanic means fall in between."
A 2013 analysis of the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that from 1971 to 2008, the size of the black–white IQ gap in the United States decreased from 16.33 to 9.94 IQ points. It has also concluded however that, while IQ means are continuing to rise in all ethnic groups, this growth is occurring more slowly among 17-year-old students than among younger students and the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing. As of 2008, a study published in 2013 by Heiner Rindermann, Stefan Pinchelmann, and James Thompson have estimated the IQ means of 17-year-old black, white, and Hispanic students to range respectively from 90.45–94.15, 102.29–104.57 and 92.30–95.90 points. They explain that the gap may persist due to the crack epidemic, the degradation of African-American family structure, the rise of fraud in the educational system (especially with respect to No Child Left Behind), the decrease in unskilled real wages and employment among African-Americans due to globalization and minimum wage increases, differences in parental practices (such as breastfeeding or reading to children), and "environmental conditions shaped by [African-Americans] themselves." To resolve this, they ultimately recommend the reestablishment of "meritoric principles" and "blindly graded objective central exams," as opposed to "ethnically based policies," in education.[74]
The following environmental factors are some of those suggested as explaining a portion of the differences in average IQ between races. These factors are not mutually exclusive with one another, and some may, in fact, contribute directly to others. Furthermore, the relationship between genetics and environmental factors may be complicated. For example, the differences in socioeconomic environment for a child may be due to differences in genetic IQ for the parents, and the differences in average brain size between races could be the result of nutritional factors. All recent reviews agree that some environmental factors that are unequally distributed between racial groups have been shown to affect intelligence in ways that could contribute to the test score gap. However, currently, the question is whether these factors can account for the entire gap between white and black test scores, or only part of it. One group of scholars, including Richard E. Nisbett, James R. Flynn, Joshua Aronson, Diane Halpern, William Dickens, Eric Turkheimer (2012) have argued that the environmental factors so far demonstrated are sufficient to account for the entire gap. Nicholas Mackintosh (2011) considers this a reasonable argument, but argues that probably it is impossible to ever know for sure; another group including Earl B. Hunt (2010), Arthur Jensen, J. Philippe Rushton and Richard Lynn have argued that this is impossible. Jensen and Rushton consider that it may account for as little as 20% of the gap. Meanwhile, while Hunt considers this a vast overstatement, he nonetheless considers it likely that some portion of the gap will eventually be shown to be caused by genetic factors.
Different aspects of the socioeconomic environment in which children are raised have been shown to correlate with part of the IQ gap, but they do not account for the entire gap. According to a 2006 review, these factors account for slightly less than half of one standard deviation of the gap.[109] Generally the difference between mean test scores of blacks and whites is not eliminated when individuals and groups are matched on socioeconomic status (SES), suggesting that the relationship between IQ and SES is not simply one in which SES determines IQ. Rather it may be the case that differences in intelligence, particularly parental intelligence, may also cause differences in SES, making separating the two factors difficult.[48] Hunt (2010, p. 428) summarises data[clarification needed] showing that, jointly, SES and parental IQ account for the full gap (in populations of young children, after controlling parental IQ and parental SES, the gap is not statistically different from zero). He argues the SES-linked components reflect parental occupation status, mother's verbal comprehension score and parent-child interaction quality. Hunt also reviews data showing that the correlation between home environment and IQ becomes weaker with age.[citation needed] Hart and Risley argue that in welfare, working-class, and professional families, children hear a large disparity in the amount of language (between 13 million and 45 million words) in the age range of 0–3, and that by age 9 these differences led to large differences in child outcomes.[110]
Other research has focussed on different causes of variation within low SES and high SES groups.[111][112][113] In the US, among low-SES groups, genetic differences account for a smaller proportion variance in IQ than among higher SES populations.[114] Such effects are predicted by the bioecological hypothesis – that genotypes are transformed into phenotypes through nonadditive synergistic effects of the environment.[115] Nisbett et al. (2012) suggest that high SES individuals are more likely to be able to develop their full biological potential, whereas low SES individuals are likely to be hindered in their development by adverse environmental conditions. The same review also points out that adoption studies generally are biased towards including only high and high middle SES adoptive families, meaning that they will tend to overestimate average genetic effects. They also note that studies of adoption from lower-class homes to middle-class homes have shown that such children experience a 12–18 pt gain in IQ relative to children who remain in low SES homes. A 2015 study found that environmental factors (namely, family income, maternal education, maternal verbal ability/knowledge, learning materials in the home, parenting factors (maternal sensitivity, maternal warmth and acceptance, and safe physical environment), child birth order, and child birth weight) accounted for the black-white gap in cognitive ability test scores.
Intelligence is a polygenic trait. This means that intelligence is under the influence of several genes, possibly several thousand. The effect of most individual genetic variants on intelligence is thought to be very small, well below 1% of the variance in g. Current studies using quantitative trait loci have yielded little success in the search for genes influencing intelligence. Robert Plomin is confident that QTLs responsible for the variation in IQ scores exist, but due to their small effect sizes, more powerful tools of analysis will be required to detect them.[142] Others assert that no useful answers can be reasonably expected from such research before an understanding of the relation between DNA and human phenotypes emerges.[87] Several candidate genes have been proposed to have a relationship with intelligence.[143][144] However, a review of candidate genes for intelligence published in Deary, Johnson & Houlihan (2009) failed to find evidence of an association between these genes and general intelligence, stating "there is still almost no replicated evidence concerning the individual genes, which have variants that contribute to intelligence differences".[145] In 2001, a review in the Journal of Black Psychology refuted eight major premises on which the hereditarian view regarding race and intelligence is based.[146]
A 2005 literature review article by Sternberg, Grigorenko and Kidd stated that no gene has been shown to be linked to intelligence, "so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time". Hunt (2010, p. 447) and Mackintosh (2011, p. 344) concurred, both scholars noting that while several environmental factors have been shown to influence the IQ gap, the evidence for a genetic influence has been circumstantial, and according to Mackintosh negligible. Mackintosh however suggests that it may never become possible to account satisfyingly for the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors. The 2012 review by Nisbett et al. (2012) concluded that "Almost no genetic polymorphisms have been discovered that are consistently associated with variation in IQ in the normal range". Hunt and several other researchers however maintain that genetic causes cannot be ruled out, and that new evidence may yet show a genetic contribution to the gap. Hunt concurs with Rushton and Jensen who considered the 100% environmental hypothesis to be impossible. Nonetheless, Nisbett and colleagues (2012) consider the entire IQ gap to be explained by the environmental factors that have thus far been demonstrated to influence it, and Mackintosh does not find this view to be unreasonable.
Therefore, a high heritability measure does not imply that a trait is genetic or unchangeable, however, as environmental factors that affect all group members equally will not be measured by heritability and the heritability of a trait may also change over time in response to changes in the distribution of genes and environmental factors.[48] High heritability also doesn't imply that all of the heritability is genetically determined, but can also be due to environmental differences that affect only a certain genetically defined group (indirect heritability).[151] The figure to the left demonstrates how heritability works. In both gardens the difference between tall and short cornstalks is 100% heritable as cornstalks that are genetically disposed for growing tall will become taller than those without this disposition, but the difference in height between the cornstalks to the left and those on the right is 100% environmental as it is due to different nutrients being supplied to the two gardens. Hence the causes of differences within a group and between groups may not be the same, even when looking at traits that are highly heritable.[151] In his criticism of the Bell Curve, Noam Chomsky further illustrated this with the example of women wearing earrings:
Multiple studies have been conducted over the past several decades to survey scientific estimates on the heritability of the IQ gap. A review by Snydermann and Rothman in 1988 found that 45% of the scientists they questioned believed the gap to be "a product of genetic and environmental variation," 15% and 1% respectively "entirely to environmental" and "genetic variation," while the remaining 38% either declined to answer or stated that the evidence was inconclusive.[158] The heritability of intelligence was estimated on average to be 59.6% for white Americans and 57.0% for black Americans among those who answered that the evidence was sufficiently conclusive.[159] The Wall Street Journal published an editorial by Linda Gottfredson in 1994, signed by 52 professors specializing in intelligence and allied fields, that estimated the heritability of individual variation to range between 40–80%, but also stating that "there is no definitive answer" to explain the racial gap.[160] Social psychologist Donald T. Campbell criticized the report, arguing that it overstated the plausibility of genetic explanations and underestimated the extent of environmental differences between races.[161] A 1995 report by the APA stated that there is more plausible evidence for an environmental than for a genetic explanation, but that there was "no adequate explanation" for the black-white IQ gap.[162][163] In a 2013 followup on Snyderman & Rothman, Rindermann et al. found the average and median estimates of the black-white IQ gap to be heritable by 47% and 50% respectively among surveyed scientists who believed that the available evidence allowed for a reasonable estimate. This survey however yielded a response rate of 18% (228 participants) compared to Snyderman & Rothman's 65% (661 participants).[164]
Mackintosh (2011, pp. 338–39) acknowledges that Jensen and Rushton have shown a modest correlation between g-loading, heritability, and the test score gap, but he does not accept that this demonstrates a genetic origin of the gap. He points out that it is exactly in those the tests that Rushton and Jensen consider to have the highest g-loading and heritability such as the Wechsler that has seen the highest increases due to the Flynn effect. This suggests that they are also the most sensitive to environmental changes. And in turn, if the highly g-loaded tests are both more liable to environmental influences and as Jensen argues, the ones where the black-white gap is most pronounced, it suggests in fact contrary to Jensen's argument that the gap is most likely caused by environmental factors. Mackintosh also argues that Spearman's hypothesis, which he considers to be likely to be correct, simply shows that the test score gap is based on whatever cognitive faculty is central to intelligence, but not what this factor is. Nisbett et al. (2012, p. 146) make the same point, noting also that the increase in the IQ scores of black test takers is necessarily also an increase in g.
Several studies have found differences between races in average reaction times. These studies have generally found that reaction times among black, Asian and white children follow the same pattern as IQ scores. Black-white differences in reaction time, however, tend to be small (average effect size .18). Rushton & Jensen (2005) have argued that reaction time is independent of culture and that the existence of race differences in average reaction time is evidence that the cause of racial IQ gaps is partially genetic instead of entirely cultural. Responding to this argument in Intelligence and How to Get It, Nisbett has pointed to the Jensen & Whang (1993) study in which a group of Chinese Americans had longer reaction times than a group of European Americans, despite having higher IQs. Nisbett also mentions findings in Flynn (1991) and Deary (2001) suggesting that movement time (the measure of how long it takes a person to move a finger after making the decision to do so) correlates with IQ just as strongly as reaction time, and that average movement time is faster for blacks than for whites. Mackintosh (2011, p. 339) considers reaction time evidence unconvincing and points out that other cognitive tests that also correlate well with IQ show no disparity at all, for example the habituation/dishabituation test. And he points out that studies show that rhesus monkeys have shorter reaction times than American college students, suggesting that different reaction times may not tell us anything useful about intelligence.
A number of studies have reported a moderate statistical correlation between differences in IQ and brain size between individuals in the same group. And some scholars have reported differences in average brain sizes between Africans, Europeans, and Asians. J. P. Rushton has argued that Africans on average have smaller brain cases and brains than Europeans, that Europeans have smaller brains than East Asians, and that this is evidence that the gap is biological in nature. Critics of Rushton have argued that Rushton's arguments rest on outdated data collected by unsound methods and should be considered invalid. Recent reviews by Nisbett et al. (2012a) and Mackintosh (2011) consider that current data does show an average difference in brain size and head-circumference between American blacks and whites, but question whether this has any relevance for the IQ gap. Nisbett et al. argue that crude brain size is unlikely to be a good measure of IQ; for example, brain size also differs between men and women, but without well-documented differences in IQ. At the same time newborn black children have the same average brain size as whites, suggesting that the difference in average size could be accounted for by differences in postnatal environment. Several factors that reduce brain size have been demonstrated to disproportionately affect black children.
“The U.S. is no longer in it, so there’s no reason to accept terms when the context has changed.” Dias said Manley represents the interests of the chief executives and large companies, not their workers. “It’s about allowing corporations to do anything they want,” said Dias. “It’s about a philosophy of free enterprise, as opposed to putting Canadians to work.” Volpe and Dias said separately that the previous Conservative government of Stephen Harper is to blame for agreeing to the original TPP deal during the 2015 federal election campaign. They said it was bad for their sector and was reached without consulting their industry until late in the process. “The TPP was about politics. It wasn’t about economics. Harper was losing in the polls, he needed it as part of his election platform,” said Dias. Japan and the U.S. agreed in secret in April 2015 on what the content provisions of automobiles ought to be and then “foisted” the agreement on Canada and Mexico, said Volpe. The Rules of Origin content levels were set at “historic lows” at 35 per cent for parts and 45 per cent for cars, which would have allowed cars built in non-TPP countries such as China and Thailand to flood the North American market, he said. The current Liberal government listened to the concerns of the auto industry and blocked a plan by the 10 remaining TPP countries to sign a newly-configured version of the Pacific Rim trade pact last month at the APEC summit, said Volpe. Trudeau incurred the wrath of Australia and Japan, who had been pushing the new, non-U.S. version of the deal. Lawrence Herman, a Toronto trade expert with Herman and Associates, said finding a way to eventually join the new TPP is vital to Canada’s trade interests — but not at the expense of the auto sector. “We just need to be sure that any trans-Pacific deal recognizes that Canada, unlike the Asian parties, is part of an integrated North American auto market,” said Herman. Scott Sinclair, senior research fellow with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the new TPP agreement is the same as the old flawed one, and the Liberals are right to be wary. “With the U.S. out, no Canadian-assembled vehicle can realistically meet the pact’s rules of origin, which amounts to a one-way opening of the Canadian auto market,” he said. “It will be impossible for the Trudeau government to honestly square this zombie pact with a genuinely progressive trade agenda.”

Lian—she still didn’t think of herself as Hornet—watched from atop a nearby roof, trying desperately to come up with a new play…but instead, thinking about what Mantis would say when they got back to base. “Why couldn’t you keep control?”, or “You have to do better, Hornet,” or the worst, “Are you sure you still want to be here?” No. She couldn’t let herself get distracted. Mantis would lecture her soon enough. Right now? She and her team had a monster to take down. She put her hand to her ear and clicked on her communicator. “Blaze, if you can hear me, stay low. Huma, get ready to come in at a 45 degree angle along the street. I have a plan. We can do this, boys.” We can do this, she thought, and she dove off the building into battle.

Lets start at the top: The Colts will take Andrew Luck (QB, Stanford) with pick one. Saint Louis picks second. They have too much money tied up in Sam Bradford to even consider a QB. Their reasonable options are as follows: Matt Kalil (OT, USC), Justin Blackmon (WR, Oklahoma State), Morris Claiborne (CB, LSU) or in the best case scenario, trade out of the pick to someone who wants Robert Griffin and accumulate more picks through the very valuable late first, second, and third rounds. The two teams thought to be interested in possibly trading up are the Redskins and the Browns. At pick three, the Vikings would love to have Kalil fall to them, as LT is their single biggest need. If he is not there and Griffin is still on the board, they will try to trade down to a team wanting Griffin as the Vikes reached to draft QB Christian Ponder in last year’s draft. If they cannot trade down and Kalil is gone, I expect them to take Morris Claiborne at this point. Now we come to the Browns at pick four (assuming they did not trade up.) If Griffin is there … should they take him?
Beyond the storyline mode that can be beat in roughly six hours of playtime, there are tons of little motivators built in to keep you coming back for more and, just like the worst of addictions, the more you use it, the more this game tightens its sinister grip around you. I must warn you, if you do have an addictive personality, turn back now and save yourself from countless hours of monotonous button mashing. You’ll find yourself hunting down elusive Pokémon to add to your insane collection or trying over and over to complete challenges with ridiculous requirements. Every level has a list of challenges with specifics that’ll keep you searching for the right Pokémon or executing the correct number of moves before you can unlock bonus capsules that sometimes contain Pokémon for your collection. Some challenges ask for you to use only Pokémon with a power level below 200 or to only use Pokémon with names beginning with “O.” There are even challenges that use the Wii U’s internal clock that require you to beat the game on a Monday or in the evening before it can be unlocked. Such requirements may seem excessive and tedious but if you really care about completing the collection, you’ll do just about anything, raising the replay value to fully beating the game somewhere in the week to month range (meaning 300 to 600 hours, and that’s a safe estimate) It’s a good time, but seriously, if you are an addictive personality, consider yourself warned.
Zero Hedge is rarely speechless, but after receiving this email from a correlation desk trader, we simply had to hold a moment of silence for the phenomenal scam that continues unabated in the financial markets, and now has the full oversight and blessing of the U.S. government, which in turns keeps on duping U.S. taxpayers into believing everything is good.I present the insider perspective of trader Lou (who wishes to remain anonymous) in its entirety:"AIG-FP accumulated thousands of trades over the years, all essentially consisted of selling default protection. This was done via a number of structures with really only one criteria - rated at least AA- (if it fit these criteria all OK - as far as I could tell credit assessment was completely outsourced to the rating agencies).Main products they took on were always levered credit risk, credit-linked notes (collateral and CDS both had to be at least AA-, no joint probability stuff) and AAA or super senior portfolio swaps. Portfolio swaps were either corporate synthetic CDO or asset backed, effectively sub-prime wraps (as per news stories regarding GS and DB).Credit linked notes are done through single-name CDS desks and a cash desk (for the note collateral) and the portfolio swaps are done through the correlation desk. These trades were done is almost every jurisdiction - wherever AIG had an office they had IB salespeople covering them.Correlation desks just back their risk out via the single names desks - the correlation desk manages the delta/gamma according to their correlation model. So correlation desks carry model risk but very little market risk.I was mostly involved in the corporate synthetic CDO side.As these trades are unwound, the correlation desk needs to unwind the single name risk through the single name desks - effectively the AIG-FP unwinds caused massive single name protection buying. This caused single name credit to massively underperform equities - run a chart from say last September to current of say S&P 500 and Itraxx - credit has underperformed massively.I can only guess/extrapolate what sort of PnL this put into the major global banks (both correlation and single names desks) during this period.For those to whom this is merely a lot of mumbo-jumbo, let me explain in layman's terms:AIG, knowing it would need to ask for much more capital from the Treasury imminently, decided to throw in the towel, and gifted major bank counter-parties with trades which were egregiously profitable to the banks, and even more egregiously money losing to the U.S. taxpayers, who had to dump more and more cash into AIG, without having the U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner disclose the real extent of this, for lack of a better word, fraudulent scam.In simple terms think of it as an auto dealer, which knows that U.S. taxpayers will provide for an infinite amount of money to fund its ongoing sales of horrendous vehicles (think Pontiac Azteks): the company decides to sell all the cars currently in contract, to lessors atbelow the amortized market value, thereby generating huge profits for these lessors, as these turn around and sell the cars at a major profit, funded exclusively by U.S. taxpayers (readers should feel free to provide more gripping allegories).What this all means is that the statements by major banks, i.e. JPM, Citi, and BofA, regarding abnormal profitability in January and February were true, howeverFor banks to proclaim their profitability in January and February is about as close to criminal hypocrisy as is possible. And again, the taxpayers fund this "one time profit", which causes a market rally, thus allowing the banks to promptly turn around and start selling more expensive equity (soon coming to a prospectus near you), also funded by taxpayers' money flows into the market. If the administration is truly aware of all these events (and if Zero Hedge knows about it, it is safe to say Tim Geithner also got the memo), then the potential fallout would be staggering once this information makes the light of day.And the conspiracy thickens.Thanks to an intrepid reader who pointed this out, a month ago ISDA published an amended close out protocol , i.e. CDS trade crosses that were not alligned with market bid/offers.Of course ISDA made it seem that it was doing a favor to industry participants, very likely dictating under the gun.

Law Schools, like car dealerships, have list prices for their wares. Tuition charges for all law schools must be stated on their web sites and in their written materials, pursuant to regulators’ (ABA, AALS) requirements. There must be some silly people out there who pay list price for their cars, I suppose, and there are certainly people who pay full tuition under the impression that that’s what everyone pays. But in reality not everyone pays list price, and those who have done so are quickly disabused when they arrive at 1L. Law Schools always want to attract the “best” students, and one way to attract them is to price discriminate, i.e., to offer discounts from list. “Best,” of course, is a concept with many possible denotations, and in days of yore American law schools tended to have diverse understandings of it. Today, though, U.S. News and World Report rankings are so influential tha they have become the cart driving the law school admissions horse. USNWR has homogenized our understanding of student value – Law School Admissions Test scores and undergraduate Grade Point Averages are the measures of student excellence. The higher the median LSAT and GPA scores of the admitted student body, the higher a law school’s ranking will be (the two factors combined account for 22.5% of a school’s ranking), and the higher the ranking, ceteris paribus, the better will be the jobs offered to graduates, the better paid will be its alumni base, the better will be the faculty lured to work there, and the better will be the students enticed to apply there. Rising ranking thus stimulates a “virtuous circle” while falling ranking leads to a “vicious circle” that, if left unattended, can result what some fear to be a “death spiral.” Buying better students is one attempt to move from a vicious circle to a virtuous one. Today, law jobs are quite hard to come by for many law school grads, and law school tuition as risen so high during the boom years that many grads are saddled with student loans they have great difficulty repaying. Bankruptcy is not normally available to discharge student loan debt. So minimizing student loans through discounts from tuition list price is a high priority for law school applicants. In our increasingly meritorious nation, the cream has often already risen to the top. The wealthy tend to be smarter and better educated than the poorer – and they tend to have children who are smarter and better educated than are the children of poorer parents.
Usually when I find CD-rs out in the world, they've been tossed out of car windows or left on the counters of stupid hipster coffeeshops. The last place I ever expected to find an unlabeled CD-r filled with music would be in the middle of the fucking desert. But nearly two years ago I was hiking in Joshua Tree and I came across a completely surreal sight: an old-school 5 1/4" computer floppy disk. It appeared to have been tossed casually near the side of the trail I was on, housed in a simple plastic baggie. I reached into the bag and pulled out the floppy disc. I noticed that the magnetic tape inside the plastic case had been replaced by a recordable compact disc. The disc had a creepy message scrawled on it which read, . I don't believe in ghosts or extraterrestrials or anything, but standing in the middle of nowhere reading that line was enough to send me into a miniature freak out. What's more, a folded-up piece of paper was also buried inside the plastic cover. A treasure map. Browned edges and everything. It featured a pirate ship (?), a series of footsteps through mountains and palm trees (?), one red X, and ten blue X's. One of of the X's appeard to be floating in the middle of a body of water.
…[the] Japanese do not impose one or two exclusive uses for every zone. They tend to view things more as the maximum nuisance level to tolerate in each zone, but every use that is considered to be less of a nuisance is still allowed. So low-nuisance uses are allowed essentially everywhere. That means that almost all Japanese zones allow mixed use developments, which is far from true in North American zoning. …[The] great rigidity in allowed uses per zone in North American zoning means that urban planing departments must really micromanage to the smallest detail everything to have a decent city. Because if they forget to zone for enough commercial zones or schools, people can’t simply build what is lacking, they’d need to change the zoning, and therefore confront the NIMBYs. And since urban planning departments, especially in small cities, are largely awful, a lot of needed uses are forgotten in neighborhoods, leading to them being built on the outskirts of the city, requiring car travel to get to them from residential areas. Meanwhile, Japanese zoning gives much more flexibility to builders, private promoters but also school boards and the cities themselves. So the need for hyper-competent planning is much reduced, as Japanese planning departments can simply zone large higher-use zones in the center of neighborhoods, since the lower-uses are still allowed. If there is more land than needed for commercial uses in a commercial zone, for example, then you can still build residential uses there, until commercial promoters actually come to need the space and buy the buildings from current residents.
Using Polymer Components To use a Polymer component in a webpage, include the library as a dependency in your boot/leiningen project file, and then :require it in your Clojure namespace, just like any other library: (ns foo.bar ...) (defpage baz (:require [miraj.polymer.paper :as paper :refer [button card]]) ...) See the Polymer hello-world demo for more detailed examples. Miraj generally follows a simple naming convention for Polymer components: <foo-bar> becomes miraj.polymer.foo/bar. For example, paper-button maps to miraj.polymer.paper/button. In some cases, another ns segment is used; for example, the function for <paper-input-container> is miraj.polymer.paper.input/container . (Documentation is incomplete, but the library source code is easily understandable.) Data Binding Helper Elements Polymer's data binding helper elements –<dom-if>, <dom-repeat>, etc. – are implemented in miraj.polymer . Some of the names have been changed to be more consistent with Clojure practice; for example, for <array-selector> we use miraj.polymer/selection. See the source code for the complete list.Lena Oxton (call sign: "Tracer") was the youngest person ever inducted into Overwatch's experimental flight program. Known for her fearless piloting skills, she was handpicked to test the prototype of a teleporting fighter, the Slipstream. But during its first flight, the aircraft's teleportation matrix malfunctioned, and it disappeared. Lena was presumed dead. She reappeared months later, but her ordeal had greatly changed her: her molecules had been desynchronized from the flow of time. Suffering from "chronal disassociation," she was a living ghost, disappearing for hours and days at a time. Even for the brief moments she was present, she was unable to maintain physical form.Overwatch's doctors and scientists were stumped, and Tracer's case seemed hopeless until a scientist named Winston designed the chronal accelerator, a device capable of keeping Tracer anchored in the present. In addition, it gave Tracer the ability to control her own time, allowing her to speed it up and slow it down at will. With her newfound skills, she became one of Overwatch's most effective agents.

A number plate confirmed the plane as the Bellanca Super Decathlon piloted by the 63-year-old millionaire. Body parts are reported to have been found inside. The search began after a hiker found items thought to belong to Mr Fossett. He vanished in September last year on a solo flight that took off 90 miles (145km) away in neighbouring Nevada.

Fuselage shattered Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said the wreckage had been spotted late on Wednesday during an aerial search of a stretch of the Sierra Nevada mountains near Mammoth Lakes.

"The crash looked so severe I doubt if someone would have walked away from it," he said. Most of the fuselage had disintegrated, with engine parts scattered several hundred feet away. Mr Anderson initially said no human remains had been found at the crash site. "It's quite often if you don't find remains within a few days, because of animals, you'll find nothing at all," he said.

Fifty people and five dog teams would carry out an extensive search of the site for Mr Fossett's remains, he added. On Thursday British entrepreneur Richard Branson paid tribute to his friend and fellow adventurer. "The most important thing is that the family know what's happened," he said. "He led an extraordinary, absolutely remarkable life, and now we can remember him for what he was and move on." The National Transportation Safety Board will be responsible for examining the wreckage. But a local official said snow was expected over the weekend, potentially hampering the investigation. The wreckage was located two days after identity documents bearing Mr Fossett's name - including a pilot's licence - as well as cash and a sweatshirt were found by hiker Preston Morrow. Mr Morrow had been returning from a mountain walk when he spotted the items in dirt and pine needles west of Mammoth Lakes. An employee at a sporting goods store, Mr Morrow said he handed them over to police after unsuccessful attempts to contact the Fossett family. The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani, in Los Angeles, says the items were found outside the vast area searched after Mr Fossett went missing - and also in a different direction to that in which he was thought to have flown. Mr Fossett took off from the ranch of hotel magnate Barron Hilton, south of Yerington, Nevada, on 3 September 2007 on a flight that was expected to last three hours. In 2002, he became the first person to circle the globe solo in a balloon and had about 100 other world records to his name.
Charges may yet come, but investigations such as this may be the new normal. Ever since the self-proclaimed Islamic State started to seize swaths of Iraq and Syria, jihadi siren songs on social media have enticed a growing pool of would-be recruits from the West. The conflict has no end in sight and police are increasingly put into the position of trying to stop suspects who cannot be proven to have broken any laws.AMD's EPYC Launch presentation focused mainly on its line of datacenter processors, but fans of AMD's new Vega GPU lineup may be interested in another high-end product that was announced during the presentation. The Radeon Instinct MI25 is a Deep Learning accelerator, and as such is hardly intended for consumers, but it is Vega based and potentially very potent in the company's portfolio all the same. Claiming a massive 24.6 TFLOPS of Half Precision Floating Point performance (12.3 Single Precision) from its 64 "next-gen" compute units, this machine is very suited to Deep Learning and Machine AI oriented applications. It comes with no less than 16 GBs of HBM2 memory, and has 484 GB/s of memory bandwidth to play with.AMD also presented a 2U server rack with EPYC processors and Radeon Instinct MI25 GPUs on-board that they have co-developed with Inventec. It is capable of a staggering 100 TFLOPS of performance.It is certainly encouraging to see AMD launching competitive products in this market segment.The high points of the presentation are available below:This is the second part of an ongoing look into the state of online gaming in Japan.

White Skin Privilege - This is a Big Lie by extremists in academia, entertainment, and media claiming that all white Euro-Americans are equally successful in all walks of life, similar to the term "model minority." This label is based on a claim to supremacy in naming; it is an example of bullying; it is based on raw hatred; it is a Big Lie; and it is profoundly dehumanizing. See the 1997 book by Jim Goad for a look at the lives of subordinated and blue-collar diverse white American peoples in the land of "white privilege." For a longer review of "white skin privilege" go here. The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by US Senator James Webb of Virginia on 7/22/10 on this very topic with good arguments if incompletely addressed. White Trash - A term that is officially a race crime in England. You People - This is a variant on "your people," "those people," and "these people." The San Jose Mercury News had a major melt down over these terms on its editorial page on 6/1/03, but the paper engages in similar identifying labels all the time. It was a challenge to understand why it can be categorized as a slur, but the reason is that "you people" is a label or name which denies those so labeled their diversity and their nationality, as well as their right to name themselves. This slur has been frequently applied to the diverse white American peoples, but the best documented example of its use (against another demographic affinity group) was Ross Perot's use of it before a convention of African Americans in 1992.Fans who can't make it to University of Phoenix Stadium for 2014 Arizona Cardinals Training Camp presented by Hyundai can follow the team's practice on Tuesday, July 29 on NFL Network's Inside Training Camp Live.

The postman just left it outside my f---ing door for anyone to take, but luckily i live in a decent are. Well anyway, when i picked it up it was actually really light in a relatively large box, so I was thinking about some million handkerchiefs or something or the infamous 4 paperclips Well anyway, I went up to the study as the things I put in my likes might not be entirely visible to my parents if really fulfilled, so you know, just some viewer privacy just in case it's a bong or a crop. Well i opened the thing, and was blinded by the colours. it took me a while to actually realise what it was, but then i figured it out and turned it upside down. It's actually really awesome. I have no idea how the ss figured out i might enjoy kids toys, but i guess r/teenagers does say enough. Well anyway, take a look at my awesome gift in action in the video below :) Thanks so much mr anonymous, i will enjoy this gift a lot... once the circumstances you told me will happen. I might just get drunk with my mum and my step dad just so that I can enjoy this gift fully. Thanks again, Jonáš :)DETROIT (WWJ/AP) – The U.S. government issued an urgent plea to nearly 8 million people to get the air bags in their cars fixed, amid concern that a defect in the devices can possibly kill or injure the driver or passengers.

Powell, Jr. “Under the First Amendment,” he wrote, in 1974, “there is no such thing as a false idea.” That is not a decree that the world brims with truth. He meant that we rely on the marketplace of ideas, rather than on judges and juries, to sort out truth from falsehood—and to continually check our understanding of the truth. The Justice was restating the central tenet embraced in New York Times v. Sullivan, in 1964, the Supreme Court’s most important decision about freedom of speech and of the press. The Court extended the scope of the First Amendment to libel law and held that, even if a citizen stated or a newspaper published criticism about a public official that was incorrect, that mistake could be punished as libel only if the critic knew or suspected that the criticism was false. In 1967, the Court applied this rule to public figures as well.
Als Merkel wil dat we als Europa aan een zeel gaan trekken – nu ook op vlak van defensie - dan zal ze voor een sociaal-economisch beleid moeten zorgen dat niet alleen goed uitpakt voor Duitsland maar voor alle landen van de Unie.

Het zijn spannende tijden.TOP 5 SPENDING TOP 5 SPENDING WASHINGTON  Tuesday's midterm elections — and the record-shattering amounts outside groups spent to oust Democratic incumbents — are just a warm-up to the 2012 presidential race, analysts and experts say. Conservative groups outspent liberal groups by a more than 2-to-1 ratio heading into an Election Day that brought the biggest Republican sweep in the House of Representatives in decades and sliced into the Democratic majority in the Senate. "The Democrats brought a bat, and the Republicans brought a grenade," said Dave Levinthal of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign money. "If you think spending is out of control by outside groups, it likely will blow your mind in the presidential election." President Obama has repeatedly lambasted conservative groups for their role in the midterm elections and criticized the Supreme Court's decision in January that opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate and union spending on election ads. Conservative spending has topped $187 million this year, up from $19.6 million in 2006, the last midterm election, the center's data show. The leader of one of the leading GOP organizations said on Wednesday that it plans to play a big role in 2012. "People wanted Congress and the president to address the economy and felt that instead the Congress and the president were pursuing an agenda that has nothing to do with what the average American wanted," said Steven Law, CEO of American Crossroads and a related group that spent more than $38 million combined to influence races. "Our goal was to amplify that," he said. "The main thing for the president to do is to listen to that for his own sake and for the country's sake. If he decides not to, we will amplify it even louder in 2012." In more than 50 House races, outside groups and party committees outspent the candidates, a USA TODAY analysis shows. Other trends: •In the 48 House contests in which outside groups spent a combined $1 million or more, Republicans won two-thirds, a USA TODAY analysis of election results and campaign reports shows. In one Upstate New York district, conservative groups such as American Crossroads, the Tea Party Express and the 60 Plus Association bought $2.8 million in negative ads attacking freshman Democratic Rep. Scott Murphy on health care, helping Republican Christopher Gibson win 55% of the vote. •Self-funded candidates of both parties faired poorly Tuesday. Only four of the 15 federal candidates who put $1 million or more into their own campaigns won on Tuesday, according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics. Wrestling executive Linda McMahon lost the Connecticut Senate race, despite spending $46.6 million — or roughly $96 per vote. By comparison, her Democratic opponent, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, spent $12 per vote with campaign and personal funds. Other self-funded candidates who lost include: former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who spent more than $142 million of her own money in the California gubernatorial contest. Some multimillion-dollar-spending candidates did have success. Republican Ron Johnson, CEO of a polymer company, spent $8.2 million of his own to oust Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. Republican Rick Scott, founder of the hospital chain Columbia/HCA, spent $73 million in a successful bid for Florida governor. •U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent $32 million on 67 House and Senate races. The USA TODAY analysis shows that 72% of chamber-backed candidates won so far. But, it spent nearly $5 million against Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who won. R. Bruce Josten, the chamber's top lobbyist, said the state's voters were out of step with the rest of the electorate. "You've got a state with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, with massive budget deficits ... and a body politic that showed absolutely no signs of coming to grips with their own economic reality." This year's spending should spur Democrats to start raising cash for their own outside efforts, said Mark Aronchick, a longtime Democratic fundraiser in Philadelphia. "Interest and advocacy groups that support the Democratic agenda need to stop wringing their hands and step up to the plate," he said.

She's filming in a Los Angeles facial capture studio for her role as Lara Croft in the forthcoming Rise of the Tomb Raider. Since the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot, Luddington has provided the basis for the face and voice of one of video gaming's most recognizable characters. A few days later, some 350 miles north of L.A. in the offices of Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics, Senior Technical Artist Jon Robins leans into his monitor and carefully studies the Luddington footage. "Making a human being is the most challenging thing when creating video games." He notes how light bounces off the ridges on Luddington's forehead, how her eyes move in a slightly different fashion for each frown, how the lines around her eyes transfer to the particulars of her smile, the angle of her cheekbones, the jut of her chin. He imports the images into facial engine models of Lara Croft. The mesh of her face represents thousand of data points. Robins manipulates blend shapes in order to tweak Lara Croft's expressions, each designed for a specific moment in the game — for a flash of peril, a quizzical exchange of dialog or an internal moment of self-reflection. He is tasked with making Lara Croft look as human as possible. She must seem like a real person while also being an action hero. She must convey both power and vulnerability. She must be visually and emotionally appealing to the player. She must seem like the same Lara Croft we have known for two decades. As Croft shows a variety of on-screen emotions, Robins sits back in his office chair and gazes at her face. He frowns. Something isn't right. It takes a moment for him to articulate the problem. There's a woman on his screen but she isn't Lara Croft. He's looking at an actor. He's looking at Camilla Luddington. Lara Croft is gone.
New horizons Rise of the Tomb Raider is the first Lara Croft game made specifically for the current console generation. It’s a timed exclusive for Xbox One (and Xbox 360), due out on Nov. 10. Rise of the Tomb Raider picks up after the events of the 2013 reboot, during which young and inexperienced archaeology graduate Lara Croft struggles to survive on a lost island infested with enemies, secrets and mysteries. In the new game Croft arrives in wintry Siberia, once again up against determined, well-armed enemies in hostile terrain, all searching for valuable artifacts. Now she is more self-confident, more assured and more certain of her place in the world. Crystal Dynamics and publisher Microsoft make much of the value of their iconic character, stressing her physical realism in promotional materials. Everyone knows Lara Croft. She is the game’s most marketable asset. "We all see people every day. We can pick up when something is wrong very quickly." Lara Croft was the first major female video game protagonist. She remains one of the most recognizable game characters in the world: a smart, ambitious, athletic, attractive young Englishwoman. Movement has always been a key component of her character, all the way back to her swishing braid in Core Design’s 1996 original. In the intervening years, she has evolved to ever-more detailed polygonal representations and fluidity of movement, up to today’s motion-captured avatar. So making her look great is taking up a lot of Crystal Dynamics’ attention. "Making a human being is the most challenging thing when creating video games," says Senior Character Artist Kam Yu. "Technological advances help us get there but it needs a lot of skills. "To make a believable character you need a good concept, the right model, shaders, animation, performance. It’s a complete package." The trouble with fake human beings is real human beings. We are very good at spotting the slightest fakery, the merest hint of offness. "We all see people every day," says Yu. "We can pick up when something is wrong very quickly. When you’re putting together a well-known character like Lara, you have to be aware of every aspect that goes into making her."
The importance of anatomy Cutscenes and action sequences in carefully choreographed Rise of Tomb Raider demos show that Croft’s creators aspire to intense physical details. Extreme cold weather pricks Croft’s skin with red patches. Her eyes reflect light convincingly. Her hair moves more like a collection of strands than a set of shapes. Unlike many inferior game characters, her teeth don’t shine luminescent. When she climbs, the muscles on her back seem connected to one another. Her clothes crease and line according to the shape of her body. This isn’t mere PR puffery. Lara Croft looks like a genuinely impressive video game avatar. It has clearly taken a great deal of work to get her to this point. "Her clothes crease and line according to the shape of her body." Studio scans are the starting point for Crystal Dynamics’ artists. Then they use their artistic skills and a facial technology called Morphology to tweak and twist. "We take elements of the scans and then we add to them," explains Yu. "When we want a particular shape, we add pose-based deformers. We can sculpt the exact shape we want all over the body: on the knees, shoulders, elbows, the waist. "In addition to those pose-based deformers, we add wrinkle maps as well. When she bends a joint, we actually see the wrinkles in her shirt change. Or if she bends her arm you’ll see the musculature in her shoulders deform." Yu’s background is in anatomical art and medical illustrations. Anatomical models and images can be seen around the desks of the art department in Crystal Dynamics’ offices. "We could never get this level of anatomical correctness in the character before," says Game Director Brian Horton, referring to the consoles and the development technology now available. "The systems just wouldn’t allow for it. Now we have so much more artist control. "From a technology standpoint, we’ve put a lot of time and energy into the formation of Lara’s character. Not only her face, but her body. We’ve created a whole new animation system that’s based on artist-sculpted shapes, to create a more believable musculature for the face and the body."
Fixing Camilla The technology used to create humans in games is changing fast. Sometimes, the artists are trying to catch up with the tech and sometimes they find themselves pushing too far. "[At one point] Lara started to look too much like Camilla," says Chief Technology Officer Gary Snethen. "Things were almost too real. We had to bring her back, to make her a video game character again and give her that iconic look. She started taking on too many human qualities. It kind of took away from her character." "Our first tests of this yielded great results and brought a lot more to some of the scenes than we thought they would." When Robins understood that Lara Croft was turning into Camilla Luddington, he and the team-leaders got to work unmaking the current build and restructuring her. It was, he understood, an issue that had been created by technology and would need to be solved the same way. "Moving onto a new console and having new blend shape tech, we wanted to rebuild our facial system from the ground up," he explains. "We looked at as much reference as possible from Camilla and general female facial features in scans and video. We wanted to make Lara as believable as possible and a solid way of doing that is bringing more of our actor to our model so that we could fully convey the emotion Camilla brings. "Our first tests of this yielded great results and brought a lot more to some of the scenes than we thought they would." But the art team thought she looked "too real," meaning that she looked like Luddington. This was the point at which they decided to bring back Croft. Croft is now being made for vastly more powerful consoles than in the past. Her parameters have changed. "We started doing paint overs on the current poses and animations," Robins explains. "This was a long process as we'd not really seen Lara at this fidelity yet and had to create a canon to work within. After iterating and testing each set of shapes on new base meshes we were able to give Lara her own identity and individual movement while preserving the great performances provided by Camilla."
The eyes have it For artists, there is no more troublesome part of the human anatomy than the eye. Video games have long suffered from uncanny valley representations of weird-looking people, eyeballs swiveling like marbles in a milky shot glass. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft is often placed in moments of peril generating scenes during which she needs to look scared, troubled, determined. All good screen actors understand that the trick is in the eyes. Recreating this artistic magic in digital, technological form is extremely tough. "The eye is a very complex system," says Snethen. "They have refraction and all sorts of internal curvature. You have to get the look of the eye right, the wetness and the micro-details within the eye. The surrounding tissue has to move just so, as the expressions enter the character." Croft’s eyes in Rise of the Tomb Raider demos aren’t perfect — there are moments when they seem too intense and slightly off — but they are better than those in most other games. "We create this illusion of the way the light bends and refracts and changes the color of the eye through the shader." "There’s only one mesh for the eyes," says Yu. "The way it shades, it makes it look like there’s a cornea over her iris. There’s parallaxing. Her eyes look a little bit different depending on where you look at them from." "When you look at the color of the eye, it bends as you move around it," says Horton. "Even though the mesh is just a simple sphere, we create this illusion of the way the light bends and refracts and changes the color of the eye through the shader. "The contact point, where the eye meets the bottom of the lid, is the tear line. There’s that extra wetness you get, the layer of tears that keeps the eye moist. Those small details are very important." "We have specific cinematic eye shaders that we use as well, so we can control the specularity, the direction of the light, the substance of the eyes," says Yu. A lot of focus has gone into the connectivity of the body and face, the interplay of how one thing connects with another. "We really focused on the connection from the eyes and brows down to the jaw and mouth," says Robins. "In previous rigs and blend shapes systems we focused too much on isolated movements and not about how each muscle is connected across the face and how some can't move without others."
To be young Lara Croft presents a particular problem for Crystal Dynamics, one that many other highly detailed game protagonists don’t face: she’s young. Most game leads are men and they are usually past the first flush of youth. They are often grizzled and wartorn. Their faces are naturally lined. "When we have a grizzled man with a craggy face, deep scars and heavy wrinkles, it’s very easy to express pained emotions. It looks just fine," says Horton. "A younger woman’s features are softer in general. When you put those harsher emotions on her, it tends to make her look different or strange. What we’re always balancing is making sure the emotional intent from Camilla is coming through, but [making sure that] it doesn’t cross a line where [Croft] looks like she’s aged 15 years or she doesn’t look like herself anymore. "There’s an acceptable amount of grizzle and grit you can put on a man in his 40s." "That, I’d say, is the greatest challenge of creating a female protagonist with this range. Their faces are inherently softer. They don’t have the cuts and details you’d see in a man. But we’re still asked to make sure all those emotions come through. It’s creating a more subtle band of wrinkle that still conveys an emotion that’s easier to express on an older male avatar." Yu says that it’s not about ensuring that Croft merely looks pretty. "Wrinkles and stuff tend to make young people look different and too extreme. On older men you have more latitude for that. On a young woman you don’t have as much latitude for that extreme. It just doesn’t wind up looking good." "There’s an acceptable amount of grizzle and grit you can put on a man in his 40s," says Horton. "Deep facial lines come across very well on a CG character. You can really push those things and it doesn’t tend to look wrong. "For a woman in her 20s, everything is much more subtle."
Arts and crafts Croft’s story in Rise of the Tomb Raider is about realizing her destiny as an adventurer and an explorer. "She’s not starting at zero in this game," says Horton. "She’s gained a lot of effectiveness, not only in her ability to traverse through the world and solve puzzles, but also as a combatant. She can hold her own. "In Rise of the Tomb Raider, we think we’re in a position to show Lara’s strength, not only her smarts, but also her ability to use the world in a smart way and hold her own in a fight." While the 2013 reboot featured a single crafting resource, Rise of the Tomb Raider tasks Croft with collecting multiple items in order to create and upgrade weapons and ammo. Players can choose to grab guns and use those to defeat enemies, but ammo is limited and guns are noisy. Croft’s collection of bows and arrows can be crafted on the fly. "When we look at Lara, it’s about her journey and her resourcefulness and her intelligence." "What I like about the crafting is that it feels like it ties the world together," says Brand Director Rich Briggs. "Lara gathers everything around you and uses it in different ways. It speaks to her resourcefulness and intelligence." Many resources are gathered by hunting animals. "Players told us that, yeah, there was hunting in the previous game, but it didn’t really have as much gameplay significance." Fan feedback has also influenced other gameplay changes. There are fewer QuickTime Events than in the last game, something which many players found irritating. In this game. Croft has the option to rely more on traversal and stealth skills than gunplay. Tombs are much larger than in the last game, with lots of trademark Lara Croft water puzzles as well as search-and-find puzzles. "She uses her movement to gain the edge on enemies," says Briggs. "Whether it’s traversal, her natural mobility or swimming underwater. She can go up trees as a new tool in combat. "Using her smarts, crafting ammo types out of the environment to whittle down the enemy one at a time, using the environment against them, that’s a way she succeeds against overwhelming odds. When we look at Lara, it’s about her journey and her resourcefulness and her intelligence."A north Idaho police officer, the target of widespread protest following his shooting of a 2-year-old black lab in July, has had his pay cut.Coeur d'Alene Police Officer David Kelley, a 17-year veteran of law enforcement, shot and killed the dog, named Arfee, through the window of a van parked outside a Coeur d'Alene coffee shop. While Kelley maintained that he was afraid of being bitten by the dog—initially reported by police as a "vicious pit bull"—a review of the incident concluded that his decision to fire on the animal violated the department's deadly force policies.A public records request has revealed that Kelley's hourly wage was cut by nearly 10 percent.Outrage over the dog shooting spilled beyond the North Idaho city onto the internet, where the Facebook page Justice for Arfee served as a hub for anger. Earlier this summer, Internet activist group Anonymous issued a pair of threats to the Coeur d'Alene Police Department, demanding a full investigation into the incident.Advertisement

On 12 December 2011, U.S. administration asked Iran to return the captured U.S. drone.[27] The day before, on 11 December, General Salami stated that "no nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin."[28] On 13 December 2011, Defence Minister of Iran, dismissed the request and said "Instead of apologising to the Iranian nation, it is brazenly asking for the drone back." And the ministry spokesman, Mehmanparast, stated that "it seems he [Obama] has forgotten that Iran’s airspace was violated, spying operations were undertaken, international laws were violated and that Iran’s internal affairs were interfered with. ... Instead of an official apology and admitting to this violation, they are making this request."[29] Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney criticised Obama's decisions on the drone, saying that, after the aircraft went down, the president should have ordered an air strike within Iran: "The right response to that would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. You can do that from the air ... and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone." Instead, "he asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to".[30] On 17 January 2012, an Iranian company said it would send miniature, pink, toy versions of the captured drone to President Obama as a response to the request for sending the drone back.

Be that as it may, on Friday I wrote about a letter sent to Lee Goldman, MD, the Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine at Columbia University complaining about Dr. Mehmet Oz's promotion of pseudoscience on his television show, which reaches millions. When I wrote my post, my first reaction was somewhat supportive, but with reservations. However, as I read your comments and thought about it some more, I started having second thoughts. Then, over the weekend, I had a rather prolonged exchange on Twitter during breaks in the action at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Meeting in Philadelphia, which I'm attending now. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that this letter, written by Dr. Henry I. Miller of the Hoover Institution, and signed by several doctors with ties to the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), was an incredibly bad idea. This evolution in my thinking was helped along by other developments over the weekend.
Before I go on further, in the interests of full disclosure, I must confess my own issues with the approach Dr. Miller and his cosignatories took. As many of you know, there have been several attempts by quacks and antivaccinationists over the years to make trouble for me at my place of work. Not too long ago, a patient of Stanislaw Burzynski complained to my dean about my posts deconstructing her testimonial that she has been telling as "evidence" that Burzynski cured her of advanced breast cancer. As odd as it seems given how vociferously critical I have been of Dr. Oz's promotion of quackery on his TV show (remember, I'm the one who coined the term "America's quack" to describe him), I must admit that seeing Miller make trouble for Oz at his job over his extracurricular activities rubbed me the wrong way. True, I suppressed my distaste when I wrote my post last Friday, so powerful is my dislike for Dr. Oz and what he does on his TV show. But it didn't stay suppressed for very long. It has been argued that with Oz it's different, because Oz promotes quackery while I promote (or at least like to think I promote) good science and medicine, but even if that's true I can't help but remember that a key purpose of a letter to a person's employer is intimidation into silence or, in Oz's case given his popularity and the security of his position, to cause embarrassment and to provoke a response.
Now here's the problem. Regardless of whether I think it's a good idea or not or simply an attempt at bullying to write a letter like this, and even though Miller's letter was correct from a scientific standpoint about Dr. Oz, if you're going to write a letter like this it's generally a good idea to know what your goal is in doing so. What, exactly, is it you're trying to accomplish by writing a letter like this? Is it to get Dr. Oz fired? That's never going to happen, given that Dr. Oz has tenure and, unfortunately, it would take a hell of a lot before a university would try to remove a tenured professor. Indeed, as I've sarcastically mentioned, given that Dr. Oz is the director of the "integrative medicine" program at Columbia, promoting the "integration" quackery with science-based medicine is basically a big part of his job description! In a real world, that wouldn't be the case and what Oz does would be a problem, but, thanks to quackademia, it's no longer shameful to do that; whole divisions and departments in various academic medical centers are devoted to it. Oh, sure, quackademics like Oz wouldn't accept that characterization of what they do as valid, but I would counter that, other than featuring psychics like John Edward or Theresa Caputo on his show, what Oz does on his show is not really much different in terms of message than what he probably at Columbia: Promote acupuncture, naturopathy, homeopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine, among other things. Again, surely Dr. Miller must know this. so I assume that his goal was not to actually get Dr. Oz fired. Indeed, Columbia issued a statement supporting Oz on the grounds of academic freedom very rapidly, and, even in the unlikely event that Columbia were to fire Dr. Oz over his show, it would remove one of the likely strongest restraints that keeps Dr. Oz from going even deeper into the woo.
Obviously, it was to create embarrassing publicity for Dr. Oz and Columbia University. After all, if Dr. Miller were really looking to cause problems for Dr. Oz he should have at least mentioned that Dr. Oz did a "made for TV" clinical trial he dubbed the "Green Coffee Bean Project" without bothering to obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval, something that is a direct violation of Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Hospital's (NYP) Human Subject Research Protection Program, which explicitly requires IRB approval for any clinical trial done by any Columbia University faculty member and NYP-affiliated faculty regardless of regardless of the location where the research is done. Now, as I pointed out, there is a slight gray area here, because clearly Oz's dubious green coffee bean clinical trial was not federally funded, but institutions that receive federal funding are required to abide by the Common Rule, which requires IRB approval of all human subjects research. Miller was either unaware of this issue, didn't realize that this was really the only "in" skeptics have to get Columbia to pay attention, or didn't care about it because what he really cares about is Oz's attack on GMOs. Mentioning that Oz conducted a dubious clinical trial for TV that was not approved by the Columbia/NYP IRB would have been a far more damning thing to mention with respect to possibly forcing Columbia to do more than issue a brief statement full of bromides about "academic freedom" than his pointed mention that Dr. Oz trashed GMOs on one of his shows.
It is important for physicians who invoke their medical degrees while endorsing products to make their allegiances and financial ties very transparent — and Dr. Oz deserves to be held to this standard. But by that standard, Dr. Miller and other self-described “distinguished physicians” on this letter also have some explaining to do. Miller, whose employer, the Hoover Institution, is often described as a “Republican-leaning” or “conservative” think tank, has interests of his own. A molecular biologist by training, Miller spent 15 years at the FDA before his fellowship at Hoover; throughout both jobs, he has been a consistent and ardent promoter of genetically engineered foods (or GMOs — the “O” standing for “organism”). And in his advocacy, Miller is positively prolific. A quick web search reveals dozens upon dozens of articles and opinion columns touting the benefits of GMOs to consumers, developing economies and agribusiness — and a seemingly equal number attacking those that warn about the possible risks of what are sometimes called “Frankenfoods.” Miller was a leading voice in opposition to California’s Prop. 37, the 2012 ballot initiative seeking clear labeling of products containing GMOs, and, in the 1990s, was an equally prominent voice in a tobacco industry-backed campaign to discredit the science linking cigarette use and cancer.
It remains to be seen just how much the postdictive illusion of choice that we observe in our experiments connects to these weightier aspects of daily life and mental illness. The illusion may only apply to a small set of our choices that are made quickly and without too much thought. Or it may be pervasive and ubiquitous—governing all aspects of our behavior, from our most minute to our most important decisions. Most likely, the truth lies somewhere in between these extremes. Whatever the case may be, our studies add to a growing body of work suggesting that even our most seemingly ironclad beliefs about our own agency and conscious experience can be dead wrong.Cards Against Humanity, before it became go-to entertainment for a generation raised on the Internet and saddled with a backward idea of political correctness, began as a crowdsourced, printable game created by a group of old high school friends. A 2011 Kickstarter campaign produced the actual cards. In the promotional video, we’re introduced to half a dozen white guys who explain that it’s for “horrible people,” or at least the type of people who like to jokingly describe themselves as such. Recently, for a Black Friday promotion, they sent 30,000 people boxes of actual bullshit. It’s that sort of thing.
Dan Kellar, 29, was recently charged with two counts of defamatory libel by officers in the OPP anti-rackets squad as he left his Kitchener home on a bicycle. He was also charged with counsel to assault one of the officers. Police allege he published comments likely to injure the reputation of the officers by exposing them to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or that were designed to insult the officers. …Kellar says the officers who arrested him are from the same unit that arrested other AW@L members and activists in connection with G20-related allegations. “The cop who arrested me is the one who’s making all the arrests for conspiracy cases,” he said. He said police agents began infiltrating activist groups before the summit. The two undercover officers joined AW@L [Anti-War at Laurier, a campus peace group], but were kicked out in the spring of 2010, before the summit, because activists didn’t feel comfortable around them, he said. …The defamatory libel charges were laid against Kellar after he put out a “community alert” on AW@L’s website, peaceculture.org. Kellar learned one of the officers had been spotted in Toronto, and, “sent out the warning…’suspected infiltrator police agent spotted in Toronto,’” he said. In the posting, he made comments police allege are defamatory.
Meanwhile, Android Oreo development is ongoing for both the OnePlus 5/5T and we’re hoping to see stable builds start dropping in January.Prior research suggests that liberals are more complex than conservatives. However, it may be that liberals are not more complex in general , but rather only more complex on certain topic domains (while conservatives are more complex in other domains). Four studies (comprised of over 2,500 participants) evaluated this idea. Study 1 involves the domain specificity of a self‐report questionnaire related to complexity (dogmatism). By making only small adjustments to a popularly used dogmatism scale, results show that liberals can be significantly more dogmatic if a liberal domain is made salient. Studies 2–4 involve the domain specificity of integrative complexity. A large number of open‐ended responses from college students (Studies 2 and 3) and candidates in the 2004 Presidential election (Study 4) across an array of topic domains reveals little or no main effect of political ideology on integrative complexity, but rather topic domain by ideology interactions. Liberals are higher in complexity on some topics, but conservatives are higher on others. Overall, this large dataset calls into question the typical interpretation that conservatives are less complex than liberals in a domain‐general way.
The Domain Specificity of Complex Thinking Complex thinking is domain‐specific.1 Someone can think highly complexly about the Iraq War, and yet still think very simply about broccoli. A lot of evidence using many different operations of complex thinking underscores this point (Conway, Schaller, Tweed, & Hallett, 2001; Houck, Conway, & Gornick, 2014; Judd & Lusk, 1984; Liht, Conway, Savage, White, O'Neill, 2011; Pancer et al., 1995; Sidanius, 1984; Suedfeld, 2000; Tetlock, Peterson, & Lerner, 1996). For example, the complexity of thinking can be affected by the importance of the content domain (Conway et al., 2008; Suedfeld, 2000) by the experience people have with the domain (Conway et al., 2008; Dasen, 1975; Suedfeld, 2000), by the heritability of the domain (Conway, Dodds, Hands Towgood, McClure, & Olson, 2011), or by the value conflict implied by the domain (e.g., Suedfeld, Bluck, Loewen, & Elkins, 1994; Tetlock, 1986). This fact of domain specificity has implications for our understanding of group differences in complexity. For example, while there is a tendency to think about cultural differences in complexity in monolithic terms, evidence (see Conway et al., 2001, for a summary) suggests that the culture‐complexity link is in fact domain‐specific. In methodological terms, the relationship between cultural groups and complexity is probably better described as a culture by topic‐domain interaction than it is by a main effect of culture (Conway et al., 2001). Ideology X Domain Interactions on Complex Thinking A primary assumption of the present article is that this same culture × domain interaction applies to political culture (defined operationally by political ideology). This idea is not new. Over 25 years ago, Tetlock (1986) pointed out that, because conservatives and liberals differ in which values are in conflict, his Value Pluralism Model predicts ideology × domain interactions. Of course, his model also predicts that integrative complexity most typically breaks left of center; thus, it expects both a main effect (liberals more complex) and interactions with issue domain. Yet it is worth noting that, while the main effect prediction has been widely discussed, the expected interaction has not.2 This is not from an initial lack of encouragement of its importance. In 1986, Tetlock (p. 825) encouraged researchers to study this topic: “Systematic study of such Ideology X Issue interactions should be a major goal of future laboratory and archival studies on this topic.” Tetlock's admonition has been largely ignored. Indeed, in the intervening 25‐plus years, very little research has been done to further this “major goal.” The research that has been done relevant to issue domain and complexity (e.g., Lavallee & Suedfeld, 1997; Suedfeld, 2000; Suedfeld et al., 1994; Suedfeld, Steel, & Schmidt, 1994) has generally not directly tested ideology X issue interactions, and, to date, no research program has systematically explored these interactions. Further, almost none of the research cited in meta‐analyses on conservative simplicity (Jost et al., 2003; Van Hiel et al., 2010) has directly accounted for such interactions.
Study 1: Dogmatism is Domain‐Specific As Jost et al. (2003) point out, dogmatism has historically been conceptualized as closed‐mindedness that is indicative of rigid, black‐and‐white thinking; for example, Rokeach described dogmatism in terms of “closed belief systems” (1960, p. 67). Such closed belief systems are a hallmark of cognitive simplicity (see, e.g., Conway et al., 2008; Tetlock, 1986), and thus it is not surprising that other researchers have noted the kinship between dogmatism and cognitive simplicity (e.g., Suedfeld, Tetlock, & Streufert, 1992). For our purposes, this clear conceptual overlap suggests that it is reasonable for us to view dogmatism as a proxy for closed‐minded, simplistic thinking. Indeed, this overlap is the impetus for dogmatism being used as one of the major arguments in the case for conservative simplicity (Jost et al., 2003). Specifically, a large body of research, mostly using versions of the Rokeach (1960) scale we use here, reveals a positive relationship between dogmatism and political conservatism (see Jost et al., 2003). The use of dogmatism as an argument in the case for conservative simplicity is partially dependent upon its conceptualization as being free of specific topic content (henceforth, domain general; see Jost et al., 2003, for a discussion). And many of its items do, on the surface, appear to be domain general. On the other hand, some research suggests that students who rate the ideological content of the Rokeach items rate them as leaning towards conservative content (see Simons, 1968), and other academics have noted (e.g., Van Hiel et al., 2010) that not all the items on the scale are free of specific content. One of the items explicitly mentions religion, another item states an explicit idea about humans being helpless and frail, and a third item states that focusing on one's happiness is contemptuous. These items explicitly identify a domain of interest and in some cases state an opinion on that domain. Thus, it is possible that the standard dogmatism scale is not really a pure measurement of domain‐general dogmatism, but rather a measurement of dogmatism that captures domains on which conservatives are more dogmatic. In the present study, we directly test the degree that the specific content of the dogmatism questionnaire matters by altering the items to reflect one of two content domains (environmental issues versus religion).
Study 1 Method Participants Four‐hundred and seventy‐five undergraduates at the University of Montana participated for course credit in large‐group sessions. Questionnaire Packets Participants completed a questionnaire packet which contained a dogmatism scale,3 a political ideology scale, and some demographic information. Dogmatism Eighteen items from Rokeach's (1960) standard dogmatism scale were used in the present study. Participants were randomly assigned one of three versions of the dogmatism scale. Some participants received the standard version of the scale as typically used in previous research on ideology (obtained from Ray, 1970). Other participants received one of two domain‐specific versions of the scale. In one condition, participants received a scale that was designed to measure their dogmatism about religion, and in another condition, participants received a scale designed to measure their dogmatism about environmental issues. These domain‐specific dogmatism scales were nearly identical to the standard scale and to each other, but they differed only in intentionally injecting content domains into the items (please see the online supplemental information for the entire scales). An example will help illustrate. A standard item on the dogmatism scale is “A group which tolerates too much difference of opinion among its own members cannot exist for long.” For the religious dogmatism scale, this item was adapted (italics and bold added for emphasis here) to say “A religious group which tolerates too much difference of opinion among its own members cannot exist for long.” The parallel environmental dogmatism questionnaire item read “An environmental group which tolerates too much difference of opinion among its own members cannot exist for long.” In this way, the two alternate domain‐specific dogmatism questionnaires kept almost all of the language from the original items but interjected a content domain (either religion or environmental issues) into the majority of those items. Inter‐item reliability for the scale was satisfactory in all three conditions (standard‐scale alpha = .74; environmental‐scale alpha = .74; religious‐scale alpha = .88). Four items on each domain‐specific scale were kept in their original (domain‐general) wording. These originally worded items appeared last in the list of 18 items. Political Ideology Participants also completed several items relevant to their political ideology. We focus on two of those here: standard bipolar items anchored by liberal/conservative and Democratic/Republican that have been used in prior research (e.g., Conway et al., 2012) and are similar to the vast majority of standard ideology measures (see e.g., Jost et al., 2003; Federico, Deason, & Fisher, 2012). These two items were highly correlated (r = .77) and thus averaged into a single measure of political conservatism (standardized alpha = .86).
Study 1 Results Correlations within Condition We first looked at correlations within each condition. Replicating prior research, the standard dogmatism scale was positively correlated with political conservatism (r[111] = .27, p < .01). Does this finding represent a domain‐general or domain‐specific phenomenon? Our next two findings suggest it is domain‐specific. First, the religion dogmatism scale—a scale specifically designed on a domain on which conservatives are more likely to be dogmatic—showed virtually the same effect as the supposedly domain‐general scale (r[184] = .33, p < .001). More importantly, are conservatives unilaterally more dogmatic across all domains? The answer is no: They were significantly less dogmatic on environmental domains, as illustrated by the negative correlation between conservatism and environmental dogmatism (r[180] = –.26, p < .001).4 Absolute Values for Conservatives and Liberals Evaluating only correlations between scales, it is conceptually possible that the negative correlation between conservatism and the liberal‐focused scale could be driven more by a rejection of those items by conservatives than by an acceptance by liberals. To look at the plausibility of this alternative, we divided participants up categorically into conservatives (those who scored above 5 on the conservatism scale) and liberals (those who scored below 5 on the scale). This analysis thus drops those directly at the midpoint of the scale. We then ran parallel 2 (Type of Scale) × 2 (Ideology) ANOVAs for dogmatism (for this analysis, we dropped the standard questionnaire). This analysis showed a significant Type of Scale × Ideology interaction (F > 29.9, p < .001). More pertinent to our purpose are the absolute values for each scale, broken down by ideology. These are presented in Table 1. As can be seen there, the highest score for simplicity was for liberals (the highest cell was liberals on environmental dogmatism). These additional analyses with absolute values make any interpretation of Study 1 results based on a lack of liberal simplicity implausible.5 Table 1.

Study 1 Discussion These results suggest that the relationship between ideology and dogmatism is domain‐specific. Conservatives are indeed more dogmatic on the religious domain; but liberals are more dogmatic on the environmental domain. It might be easy to dismiss these effects as reflecting the content preferences of liberals and conservatives (and thus as not reflecting anything about dogmatism per se). There are two reasons why we think such a dismissal would be premature. First, the dismissal is a double‐edged sword. If the question is “do prior results suggest that conservatives are more dogmatic?” then simply dismissing our results as only having to do with content raises the possibility that all dogmatism scales are picking up on content primarily (and not dogmatism per se). Second, more importantly, a quick dismissal of these findings does not capture the subjective nature of the items themselves. For example, consider that for dogmatism, liberals scored higher on the following questions: There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are for the truth that the planet is warming and those who are against that obvious truth. When it comes to stopping global warming, it is better to be a dead hero than a live coward. A person who thinks primarily of his/her own happiness, and in so doing disregards the health of the environment (for example, trees and other animals), is beneath contempt. The subjective tone of those statements is not merely “I am an environmentalist” but rather “all people who disagree with me are fools.” In these and other items from the scale, liberals are consenting to (1) categorizing the world into only two kinds of people, those that are right and those that are wrong, (2) a scorn of those unwilling to die for a cause, (3) a belief that persons who disagree with them are “beneath contempt,” (4) a belief that the only method for understanding the truth is to rely on experts, (5) an expression that true living involves believing in their cause, and (6) an appeal to the temporal urgency of the cause. Those are not just statements about having an environmental position: They are explicitly and overwhelmingly dogmatic statements. And liberals are more likely to agree with such sentiments—for an environmental domain.
Studies 2–4: Integrative Complexity is Domain‐Specific The dogmatism measurement used in Study 1 has been widely used to make a case for conservative simplicity, but it is not without its problems (see Van Hiel et al., 2010). It is dependent on participants’ own self‐perceptions and willingness to express them; it also contains explicit ideological content. Although, as we have discussed, that “ideological content” argument cuts both ways and does not undermine our present purpose, it would nonetheless be advisable to also use a more open‐ended measure that ameliorated some of these problems. With that in mind, we turn next to one such open‐ended measurement of the complexity of thinking: Integrative complexity (e.g., Suedfeld & Streufert, 1966; Suedfeld & Tetlock, 1976; see also Harvey, Hunt, & Schroder, 1961; Schroder, Driver, & Streufert, 1965). Integrative Complexity Integrative complexity, which formed an important part of Jost et al.'s (2003) case for conservative simplicity, is used to assess the complexity of spoken or written communications according to their basic structure (see, e.g., Suedfeld & Bluck, 1988; Suedfeld, Bluck, & Ballard, 1994; Suedfeld & Leighton, 2002; Suedfeld & Rank, 1976). Passages are coded and assigned a score between 1 and 7 based on the level of differentiation (i.e., the extent to which differing dimensions are used to describe a given topic) and, if more than one dimension is present, integration (i.e., the joining of these multiple dimensions; see Baker‐Brown et al., 1992, for integrative complexity scoring details). In assigning complexity scores, the particular position argued for by the speaker/writer is irrelevant; the score is based on the structure of the passage. As such, the construct is able to capture the underlying mechanisms of the complexity of thought on a broad level that is conceptually independent of the content domain of the passage. It is in part for this domain‐general breadth that integrative complexity is the most widely used scoring system for measuring the complexity of open‐ended statements (e.g., Conway, Conway, Gornick, & Houck, 2014; Conway & Gornick, 2011; Conway et al., 2012; Conway, Suedfeld, & Clements, 2003; Conway, Suedfeld, & Tetlock, 2001; Houck et al., 2014; Suedfeld & Bluck, 1988; Suedfeld et al., 1994; Suedfeld & Leighton, 2002; Suedfeld & Tetlock, 1976; Tetlock, 1984, 1986). Domain Specificity Although it is intended to be a “content free” measurement, this does not mean that participants’ complexity is uninfluenced by the domain of interest. Indeed, although content domain is not often a subject of inquiry in integrative complexity research, topic domain has been shown to influence integrative complexity in some lines of research (Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011; Conway et al., 2012; Pancer et al., 1995; Suedfeld, 2000; Suedfeld, Bluck et al., 1994; Suedfeld & Wallbaum, 1992; Tetlock, 1986; Tetlock, Peterson, & Lerner, 1996). In all this work, the specific content domain that people wrote or talked about mattered for the ultimate complexity they produced. Thus, it is worth considering more fully the possibility of ideology × topic domain interactions on integrative complexity. Our Focus on Dialectical Forms of Integrative Complexity Recently, a new scoring system for parsing integrative complexity scores into different types of complexity has been scientifically validated (Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011). In particular, some integrative complexity scores are driven by dialectical complexity, which is complexity achieved by giving legitimacy to two opposing viewpoints. On the other hand, some integrative complexity scores are driven by elaborative complexity, which is complexity achieved by defending or expanding upon one particular viewpoint (see Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011). All materials in studies 2–4 in the present article were scored for integrative complexity and the two subtypes outlined in Conway et al. (2008). However, we here opt to present results in those studies on dialectical forms of complexity. Our reasons for doing so are three‐fold. First, almost all of the prior work on integrative complexity cited in meta‐analyses by Jost et al. (2003) and Van Hiel et al. (2010) comes from Tetlock. When scoring integrative complexity, Tetlock has only coded dialectical forms of complexity in his work (see Conway et al., 2008, for a review). As a result, the best direct comparison with prior work showing conservative simplicity is dialectical complexity. Second, this focus makes conceptual sense, because dialectical forms of complexity most clearly map on to the “rigidity of the right” idea. It is in their inability or unwillingness to think about things from different points of view that conservatives are supposed to be lacking: And dialectical complexity best captures that aspect (see Conway et al., 2008). Third, our results are inferentially stronger and more consistent using dialectical forms of complexity, and thus we acknowledge that part of our decision to present this set of results is ad hoc. However, we also performed all analyses using the larger integrative complexity construct, and the overall pattern of results in most cases is similar (see footnote 12 for details). It is indeed noteworthy that the key moderating effects reported here are strongest for the form of complexity (dialectical complexity) on which conservatives are supposed to be weakest. Using dialectical complexity below in Studies 2–4, we show that, contrary to the conservative simplicity hypothesis, no main effect emerges of ideology on complexity. Instead, these results are better characterized by an ideology × topic domain interaction.
Study 2 Method Participants Over a three‐year span, 1,529 undergraduate participants at the University of Montana completed questionnaire packets, usually in large sessions exceeding 100 persons.6 Complexity Question Stems Participants completed one of 13 possible question stems that mostly dealt with political and social issues (example topic stems include “death penalty,” “abortion,” and “organized religion”). These questions were later coded by trained scorers for integrative complexity. Most of these items were chosen because they had been previously assessed for their heritability in one of two prior, well‐known heritability research programs (Eaves, Eysenck, & Martin, 1989; Martin, Eaves, Heath, Jardine, Feingold, & Eysenck, 1986; see Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011 for descriptions of topic selection). Complexity Coding Study 2 was scored by coders who had taken an intensive training course and achieved a .85 reliability score with an expert integrative complexity coder and who had subsequently received training in scoring the subconstructs. Responses were coded by 4–5 coders in “blocks” of around 500 responses each. For each block, every coder of that block scored all participants (and thus all topics) for that block. Thus, summary scores provided below are the average of 4–5 coders for each participant. To check for reliability, we computed standardized alphas for each block separately (because all coders scored all responses in each block, an alpha is an appropriate metric of reliability). Reliability on each of the different blocks was satisfactory, with standardized alphas for dialectical complexity ranging from .86 to .89 (M = .88). Ideology Measurement All participants completed the same two continuous measurements of political ideology used in Study 1. These were averaged to produce a single continuous “political conservatism” score. For both Studies 2 and 3, we converted this score into a categorical measurement in a manner identical to our method in Study 1 for testing absolute values. We did this because the current conceptual case being made is that conservatives are simple‐minded. Because the slope of the line in a correlation might not fully capture differences between persons on each side of the liberal/conservative divide, there is value in considering what people who classify themselves as being on the “conservative” side of the ledger are like, as compared to those on the “liberal” side, in more categorical terms. In addition, using a regression‐based approach for Studies 2 and 3 would be fairly cumbersome, due to the large number of topic domains (with topic domain serving as one of the primary IVs). Thus, for ease of testing interactions, an ANOVA‐based approach that uses categories for political ideology is more practically useful. Persons who scored above the midpoint were categorized as conservative, while those below the midpoint were categorized as liberal. This removed participants right at the midpoint, leaving 1,323 for our main analyses in Study 2 (liberal = 852; conservative = 471). Results and Discussion Analyses were first performed within a 2 (Ideology: Leans Right versus Leans Left) × 13 (Topic Domain) Factorial ANOVA. By far the strongest effect was for Topic Domain F(12, 1297) = 9.30, p < .001. No main effect of ideology emerged, with Conservatives (M = 1.72) and Liberals (M = 1.72) having virtually identical overall complexity means. However, an Ideology × Topic Domain interaction emerged, with Conservatives higher on some topics and Liberals higher on others, interaction F(12, 1297) = 2.03, p < .02. To understand the degree that this interaction was driven by conservative or liberal complexity (or both equally), we created some ad hoc categories representing the upper tertile of topics on which conservatives and liberals, respectively, were highest in complexity (defined by the difference between conservatives and liberals on complexity for that topic).7 Topics for which Conservatives were higher were: Death penalty is barbaric and should be abolished, Socialism, Refugees, and George W. Bush. Topics for which Liberals were higher on complexity were: People should find out if they are sexually suited before marriage, Bible truth, Alcohol, and Censorship. (These analyses remove the middle tertile of topics for which liberals and conservatives were roughly equal in complexity). A 2 (Ideology) × 2(Ad Hoc Domain Type: Conservatives Higher or Liberals Higher) ANOVA revealed, predictably, an interaction between Ideology and Domain Type, F(1, 734) = 12.31, p < .001. As can be seen in Table 1, this interaction is clearly a true crossover interaction, with conservatives scoring higher than liberals on some topics, while the reverse is true for others. Indeed, within‐domain type correlations showed roughly similar effect sizes for topics on which conservatives were higher in complexity (conservatism‐complexity r[346] = .12, p < .03) and topics on which conservatives were lower in complexity (conservatism‐complexity r[511] = ‐.08, p < .06; Fisher's Z‐test comparing correlations = 2.87, p < .01). In other words, the interaction between domain type and ideology is roughly equally attributable to the fact that conservatives were sometimes higher than liberals on complexity as it is to the fact that liberals were sometimes higher than conservatives.
Study 3 Method Participants Over a two‐year span, 728 undergraduate participants at the University of Montana completed an open‐ended question pertaining to an array of attitudes in exchange for course credit, usually in large sessions exceeding 100 persons.8 Complexity Question Stems The 30 question stems were taken directly from a research program that was not motivated by ideology, but rather because they had been previously assessed for their heritability in a project (Olson, Vernon, Harris, & Jang, 2001) that was independent of the heritability program used in Study 2. Complexity Coding As in Study 2, Study 3 was scored by 4–5 trained coders in “blocks” of around 400 responses each. For each block, every coder of that block scored all participants (and thus all topics) for that block. Thus, summary scores provided below are the average of 4–5 coders for each participant. To check for reliability, we computed standardized alphas for each block separately. Reliability on each of the different blocks was satisfactory, with standardized alphas for dialectical complexity ranging from .81 to .82 (M = .81). Political Ideology We measured ideology in a manner identical to Study 2 and further computed a single categorical score identical to that study. This method (which removes participants scoring directly at the midpoint of the scale) left 633 for our main analyses (liberal = 395; conservative = 238). Results and Discussion Initial analyses were performed within a 2 (Ideology: Leans Right versus Leans Left) × 30 (Topic Domain) Factorial ANOVA. Once again, by far the strongest effect was for Topic Domain F(29, 573) = 2.91, p < .001. No main effect of ideology emerged, with Conservatives (M = 1.74) and Liberals (M = 1.76) having virtually identical complexity means. Unlike in Study 2, no clear Ideology × Topic Domain interaction emerged in Study 3. However, the descriptive data suggested that sometimes conservatives were higher than liberals on some topics and vice versa, but that small cell sizes (in some cases n = 7) and the large number of cells made it difficult to find an effect in the 2 × 30 ANOVA. We subsequently followed an ad hoc procedure identical to that in Study 2: Specifically, we created some ad hoc categories representing the upper tertile of topics on which conservatives and liberals, respectively, were highest in complexity. Topics for which Conservatives were higher were: Wearing clothes that draw attention, Exercising, Death penalty, Open‐door immigration, Smoking, Reading books, Castration, Loud music, Roller coaster rides, and Easy access to birth control. Topics for which Liberals were higher on complexity were: Being assertive, Organized religion, Crosswords, Public speaking, Abortion on demand, Big parties, Playing organized sports, Making racial discrimination illegal, Education, Being the center of attention. (This analyses removes the middle tertile of topics for which liberals and conservatives were roughly equal in complexity.) A 2 (Ideology) × 2 (Ad Hoc Domain Type) ANOVA revealed an interaction between Ideology and Domain Type, F(1, 374) = 21.39, p < .001. As can be seen in Table 1, this interaction is clearly a true crossover interaction, with conservatives scoring higher than liberals on some topics, while the reverse is true for others. Indeed, within‐domain correlations showed roughly similar effect sizes for topics on which conservatives were higher in complexity (conservatism‐complexity r[230] = .15, p < .03) and topics on which conservatives were lower in complexity (conservatism‐complexity r[207] = −.20, p < .01; Fisher's Z = 3.67, p < .01). In other words, the interaction between domain type and ideology is roughly equally attributable to the fact that conservatives were sometimes higher than liberals on complexity as it is to the fact that liberals were sometimes higher than conservatives.9,10
Additional Results from Studies 1–3 To this point, we have talked loosely about ideology × domain interactions without clearly specifying the psychological explanatory variables that might account for such interactions. This is partially purposeful—our primary goal in this article is to discuss the potential for such interactions at a large level and not to engage in a debate about the specific psychological mechanisms underlying those interactions. However, on a subset of our data for Studies 1–3, we collected a few variables relevant to mechanisms that we believed might help explain those interactions. (We did not collect any of these additional variables for Study 4.) Thus, while not our primary purpose, we briefly summarize the outcome of those analyses here. Although we measured other variables (for a summary, see footnote 11), we specifically focus on a set of variables related to a given domain's attitude strength. Conceptually and empirically, attitude strength/involvement is negatively related to dialectical forms of complexity (see Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011). Thus, it is possible that liberals and conservatives differ on what topics they hold strong attitudes on, and this fact might help us better understand the domain‐specific effects of conservatism on complexity. We tested the implications of this in Studies 1–3. Study 1 For Study 1, all participants who completed the domain‐specific dogmatism scales also completed several measurements relevant to attitude strength/involvement with the topic domain: (1) topic importance, (2) involvement with the topic, (3) experience with the topic, (4) confidence in their opinion on the topic, and (5) attitude extremity (represented by how far they were from the midpoint in absolute terms on an agreement item). We converted each measurement to a z‐score and averaged them into an overall attitude strength score. Conceptually, if conservatives and liberals differed in what topics they were dogmatic about due to differences in attitude strength, then liberals should hold stronger attitudes on the topics they were more dogmatic on (and vice versa for conservatives). This conceptual logic directly predicts an ideology × topic type interaction on attitude strength, such that liberals would hold weaker attitudes on topics for which they scored lower in dogmatism (in this case, religion), while conservatives would hold weaker attitudes on topics for which they scored lower in dogmatism (in this case, environmental issues). We tested this by computing an ideology (liberal versus conservative) × topic type (environment versus religion) interaction on attitude strength. Results were consistent with our conceptual logic: Conservatives held stronger attitudes for the domain on which they were more dogmatic (conservatives = .27, liberals = .10), while liberals held stronger attitudes for the domain on which they were more dogmatic (conservatives = −.34, liberals = −.04), interaction F(1,304) = 8.69, p < .01. Studies 2 and 3: Attitude Strength/Involvement We performed a similar set of analyses on Studies 2 and 3. In particular: On a subset of our data that comprised part of the sample for Studies 2 and 3 (n = 423), immediately after completing the open‐ended statements that were scored for complexity, participants also completed measurements of attitude strength identical to those used in Study 1. As in Study 1, we converted each measurement to a z‐score and averaged them into an overall attitude strength score. Conceptually, if conservatives and liberals differed in what topics they were more complex about due to differences in attitude strength, then liberals should hold stronger attitudes on the topics they were less complex on (and vice versa for conservatives). Thus, we computed ideology (liberal versus conservative) × ad hoc topic type (liberal higher in complexity versus conservative higher in complexity) interactions. Results were largely descriptively consistent with attitude strength being an explanatory variable, but the inferential statistics were not overwhelming. In particular, for Study 2, conservatives held stronger attitudes for topics on which liberals were higher in complexity (conservatives = .16, liberals = −.04), while liberals held stronger attitudes for topics on which conservatives were higher in complexity (conservatives = −.07, liberals = .00). However, this interaction was not statistically significant (p = .184). A similar pattern emerged for Study 3, where conservatives held stronger attitudes for topics on which liberals were higher in complexity (conservatives = .21, liberals = −.04), while this difference was essentially not in evidence for topics on which conservatives were higher in complexity (conservatives = .05, liberals = .04). However, this interaction was also not statistically significant (p = .262).11
Study 4: 2004 Bush‐Kerry Debates George W. Bush has often been discussed as a prototypical representative of simple‐minded conservatives (e.g., Simonton, 2006). But if, as we have argued, complexity is largely driven by topic domain, then it is important to consider what domain politicians are talking about. In Study 4, we compare Bush versus his opponent in the 2004 election campaign, John Kerry, across 15 different topics that were discussed during the presidential debates. Method Paragraph selection Across three presidential debates, the two candidates were specifically directed to discuss 15 different topics, ranging from domestic issues (e.g., the economy) to moral discussions (e.g., abortion) to foreign policy (e.g., the Iraq war). From each debate, we randomly selected five paragraphs per topic per candidate. If the candidate did not provide five paragraphs in a given debate for a given topic, we used all the available paragraphs for that topic. Paragraph preparation and scoring As is standard in archival integrative complexity research (e.g., Conway & Conway, 2011; Suedfeld & Rank, 1976; Tetlock, 1984; Thoemmes & Conway, 2007), we removed all information from the selected paragraphs that might directly identify who the speaker is and replaced that with generic information, and then we presented the paragraphs in random order to four trained scorers. All scorers coded all paragraphs. Interrater reliability for the current project was satisfactory (dialectical complexity alpha = .75). The four coders’ scores were averaged into a single complexity score. Results and Discussion Analyses were first performed within a 2 (Candidate: Bush Versus Kerry) × 15 (Topic Domain) Factorial ANOVA. By far the strongest effect was for Topic Domain F(14, 65) = 2.40, p < .01. No main effect of ideology emerged, with Conservative Bush (M = 1.45) and Liberal Kerry (M = 1.48) having virtually identical overall complexity means. However, an Ideology × Topic Domain interaction emerged, with Bush higher on some topics and Kerry higher on others, interaction F(14, 65) = 1.88, p < .05. To understand the relative strength of Bush's and Kerry's complexity in contributing to this interaction, we created some ad hoc categories by grouping topic types together on which Bush's and Kerry's complexity differed. Specifically, we created difference scores for each topic representing the degree that either Bush or Kerry was higher on complexity for that topic, and then used the upper tertile of these difference scores for each candidate to create two categories: The five topics for which Bush was higher in complexity and the five topics for which Kerry was higher. (This strategy is analogous to the strategy for creating ad hoc categories in Studies 2 and 3). Using these criteria, the topics on which Bush was higher than Kerry were: Religion, Terrorism/Homeland Security, Stem Cells, Healthcare, and Affirmative action. The topics on which Kerry was higher than Bush were: Iraq, non‐Iraq foreign policy issues, economic issues, Abortion, and Education. A 2 (Candidate) × 2 (Ad Hoc Domain Type: Bush Higher or Kerry Higher) ANOVA revealed an interaction between Ideology and Domain Type, F(1, 58) = 15.44, p < .001. As can be seen in Table 1, this interaction is clearly a true crossover interaction, with Bush scoring higher than Kerry on some topics, while the reverse is true for others. Indeed, comparisons within‐domain type showed roughly similar effects for topics on which Bush was higher in complexity (effect of candidate t[28] = 2.93, p < .01) and topics on which Kerry was higher in complexity (effect of candidate t[30] = −2.63, p < .02).12 In other words, the interaction between domain type and ideology is roughly equally attributable to the fact that Bush was sometimes higher than Kerry on complexity as it is to the fact that Kerry was sometimes higher than Bush.13
General Discussion Are conservatives simple‐minded? The present results suggest the answer to this question is “yes…but only on some topics.” On other topics, conservatives are more complex than liberals. Using a large array of topic domains and methods, we found that the ideology‐complexity relationship is perhaps best described as an interaction between ideology and topic domain. Is this interaction hiding a larger main effect of conservative simplicity? Although we found no evidence here of the much‐assumed main effect difference between liberals and conservatives, our article is not an attempt to definitively answer that question with a “no.” Rather, the results presented here suggest that more caution should be given to definitively answering that question with a “yes.” It may be that liberals are, as many have claimed (Jost et al., 2003; Tetlock et al., 1996; Van Hiel et al., 2010) and as some of even our own prior work suggests (Conway et al., 2012; Thoemmes & Conway, 2007), pulled towards complexity more than conservatives: But we think such a judgment is premature. What Mechanism Might Explain Domain Differences in Complexity? Our primary purpose in this article is not to explain domain differences but to demonstrate domain × ideology interactions. It is nonetheless important moving forward to address what psychological aspects of topic domains might help us better understand when conservatives are more or less complex than liberals. We tested several possibilities on a subsample of our data, and the most promising explanatory variable to emerge was attitude strength. Conservatives and liberals differ on the topics for which they hold strong attitudes; and it may be that this variability in attitude strength helps us understand variability on complexity. Our data reveal evidence that is modestly consistent with this hypothesis: Across all three studies for which data was available, both conservatives and liberals held stronger attitudes for the topics on which they were more simple‐minded (operationalized in Study 1 as topics for which they were more dogmatic and in Studies 2 and 3 as topics for which they were less complex). Although this pattern was weaker for Studies 2 and 3,14 these results provide some preliminary evidence that the ideology × domain interactions on complexity‐relevant variables may be partially a function of domain differences in attitude strength. This suggests two possible ways forward for future researchers. First and most obviously, it would be useful to run studies with greater power for testing the explanatory ability of attitude strength measurements. This could be done by collecting a larger group of participants, but it also might be useful to select topics a priori that were especially prone to show attitude strength differences between liberals and conservatives and run more focused tests with those domains or otherwise directly manipulate attitude strength (rather than merely measuring it as we did in the present studies). Second, the measurements reported here are only one set of possible (and potentially imprecise) methods for measuring the attitude strength construct. Given the potential explanatory value of attitude strength in our understanding of complexity‐related domain variability, future work would do well to include more sophisticated methods of measuring attitude strength that do not rely solely on direct self‐report (e.g., Fazio, Jackson, Dunton, & Williams, 1995). Sample Limitations This research is not without its limitations. First, our work is entirely constrained to U.S. samples and thus should be interpreted with appropriate caution. We do not know if the results presented in Studies 1–3 would generalize beyond U.S. borders, and the results from Study 4 are from a single U.S. election. What might this mean for our interpretation of the results? First, it is important to note that much of the case for conservative simplicity has been compiled on U.S. samples. For example, in Jost et al.'s (2003) meta‐analysis, 81% of the reported N for integrative complexity and 44% of the reported N for dogmatism occurred on U.S. participants. Since part of our aim is to offer a potential alternative explanation for existing evidence in these areas, our data at least suggest that for the part of the current case which has been built on U.S. samples (a fairly large percentage), we should perhaps reconsider our collective interpretation of the evidence. However, it is of course still worth considering the potential effect of the cultural context on our results. Consider, for example, that one of the most salient differences distinguishing the United States from other potential Western samples is that the United States as a whole is more conservative than many other Western nations. What effect might this have? According to one of the most influential models of the origins of complex thinking, Tetlock's Value Pluralism Model (e.g., Tetlock, 1986; Tetlock et al., 1996), if this had any effect, it would be likely to bias the sample by making U.S. liberals more complex than liberals in other places (in particular on dialectical forms of complexity; see Conway et al., 2008).15 If the United States leans right as a nation, that means that those we call “liberals” are actually more “centrist”—and it is centrists that the Value Pluralism Model (and a related model of belief defense; for discussions, see Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011) predicts would be most complex. As a population, this would make the United States a skewed test that would more likely make liberals complex, because liberals in the United States would actually be less likely to be true liberals—but would in fact be moderates who are more likely on average to be complex (see, e.g., Tetlock et al., 1994). Thus, in a sense, our finding no main effect (and instead finding domain × ideology interactions) in a U.S. sample is more—rather than less—compelling evidence against the conservative simplicity hypothesis. Consistent with this notion, it is worth noting that additional research on integrative complexity and related measurements—research not cited in Jost et al. (2003)—suggests that if anything, the conservative simplicity effect may be less likely to be found in non‐U.S. contexts. For example, Van Hiel and Mervielde (2003) correlated political conservatism amongst Belgian college students with three measurements of complexity, and none of the measurements was statistically significant. Further, in Soviet Russia, leftist communist leaders were less integratively complex than capitalistic reformers who had a more conservative ideology (Tetlock & Boettger, 1989). Quite a bit of research on Canadian political parties is also inconsistent with the conservative simplicity hypothesis. For example, comparing Canadian college students affiliated with two conservative and two liberal political parties, Suedfeld et al. (1994) found no significant differences among them, and the highest overall group on complexity was the conservative Progressive Conservative party. Similar results for Canadian politicians were found by Suedfeld's (2000) scoring of the major political parties’ candidates for Prime Minister during the 1997 Federal election. Finally, Lavallee and Suedfeld (1997) found that more liberal environmental groups scored lower in integrative complexity (though not significantly so) than more conservative forest advocacy groups in a conflict in British Columbia over Clayquot Sound. In summary, we do not view it is likely that our results will end up being relevant to only the United States—they may indeed be more powerful in other regions.16 However, it is further worth noting that to the degree that our sample does in fact differ from other samples and would yield different results, this itself poses a problem for the rigidity of the right explanation. Even should our results prove to be specific only to the United States, this suggests at a minimum that cultural context is a potential moderator of the conservatism‐complexity relationship. Given how alarmingly few cultural contexts have actually been tested, this leaves open the possibility that, averaged across all cultures, we may find a far weaker (or even nonexistent) main effect for the conservatism‐complexity relationship. Thus, while we cannot of course definitively say that our work would generalize, our work at least makes it clear that we should pause in our larger conclusions about the relationship between conservatism and domain‐general simplicity. Research Content Limitations Our discussion has covered two of the major constructs in the argument for conservative simplicity: dogmatism and integrative complexity. But the case for conservative simplicity includes much more than just research on those constructs, and it includes quite a bit of evidence our domain‐specificity theory does not account for even within those two lines of work. It does not seem very likely that ideology × domain interactions account for all of the additional evidence discussed by Jost et al. (2003). As such, caution is warranted in interpreting these results in the larger picture. Indeed, consider three lines of evidence discussed in Jost et al. (2003) and Van Hiel et al. (2010): Need for closure/structure, openness, and preference for complexity (e.g., preferences for complex visual images and complex poetry). In each case, quite a bit of evidence exists tying political conservatism to a motive for simplicity; conservatives are higher in self‐reported need for closure/structure (and, in a more nuanced recent account, liberals who are higher in need for closure show more conservative policy positions; see Federico et al., 2012), lower in self‐reported openness, and lower in self‐reported preferences for complex images or poems. Each of those areas could potentially capture a more domain‐general motive—for example, need for closure is conceptualized as a need for nonspecific closure that cuts across domains—and yet our research cannot directly speak to that work. How, then, do we reconcile our work to this prior work? We discuss three different points of intersection below (see the online supplementary information for additional discussion in this regard). The multidimensionality of complexity and why it matters Even if we assume that this prior work on need for closure/structure, openness, and preferences for complex materials represent phenomena on which conservatives are indeed simpler, that would not invalidate the importance of our present findings. As many researchers have pointed out, complexity itself is multifaceted (see, e.g., Conway et al., 2014; Houck et al., 2014; Tetlock, Emlen Metz, Scott, & Suedfeld, 2014). Thus, even if the present results turn out to be limited only to dogmatism and integrative complexity—two aspects of the case being made for conservative simplicity—that would nonetheless suggest for complexity relevant to those types, the general case being made against conservatives in those areas needs revision. This would present to us a more nuanced and accurate picture of the relationship between ideology and complexity and suggest at the least that the current picture must be qualified by the type of complexity measurement under the microscope. The potential pitfalls of self‐report measurement Further, for the purposes of determining the average complexity of a group of persons, the kinds of self‐report measurements comprising the bulk of prior meta‐analyses have some additional potential pitfalls in interpretation. A self‐report measurement is at best an indirect marker of a potential complexity‐relevant motive. To take one example, Person A may be higher than Person B on the need for closure scale because they are actually more motivated for closure; but they also may be higher because they are more willing to report higher need for closure (even though both persons may actually have the same level of motive), or have a different set of social desirability templates, or a host of other factors that do not have to do with the actual motive.17 Further, self‐report measurements vary in their degree of clear overlap with complexity. Consider that the need for structure scale was intentionally designed to avoid explicitly mentioning cognitive structure (see, e.g., Neuberg & Newsom, 1993). Both the need for structure scale and the highly correlated and conceptually similar need for closure scale contain items that appear like conscientiousness as much as cognitive structure, and the need for structure scale is in fact correlated with both self‐reported conscientiousness and conscientious behaviors (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993). While need for structure/closure has been sometimes correlated with more face‐valid measurements of complexity (e.g., Neuberg & Newsom, 1993; Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and is related to attitudinal “seizing” that seems clearly conceptually related to complex thinking (e.g., Webster & Kruglanski, 1994), it is nonetheless worth considering that the scales do not directly measure a desire to think in a complex fashion. In contrast, the scoring of open‐ended statements is a much more direct marker of the average complexity of particular groups (see Houck et al., 2014). While it, too, has its drawbacks, this at the very least means that when Person A scores higher than Person B, we can feel more confident that the output of Person A is indeed more complex than Person B on that domain. Thus, this provides a more direct marker of the outcome of interest—complexity—than do more indirect measurements of a self‐reported motive that is expected to be correlated to the outcome. The importance of the potential divergence between self‐report and open‐ended measures is underscored by the fact that the two types of measurements are often not very highly correlated (see Van Hiel et al., 2010, for a summary). Empirical scope of the present research Our work shows a different pattern of results than quite a bit of prior work. Why is that the case? There are three conceptual reasons why the literature writ large might differ with the results presented here. The first is the primary argument made in this article: That prior work has not fully accounted for domain × ideology interactions. But it may also be that our results are simply anomalous. After all, for any real effect in psychology, sometimes you will not find that effect, or find a reversal of the effect, just by chance. Relatedly, it is also possible that our results represent an overselection of topics on which conservatives score more complexly. Even if one grants the power of ideology × domain interactions, it of course does not follow that there is no meaningful main effect (see, e.g., Tetlock et al., 1996). Conservatives may be more complex than liberals on a certain handful of topics, but this may run counter to the general tendencies outlined by Jost et al. (2003) to pull them, at some larger psychological level, towards simplicity. Indeed, it is possible that we ourselves are exhibiting a bias in topic selection: Although the topics selected here (with a few exceptions) were not largely selected for reasons directly related to ideology at all (see Conway et al., 2008; Conway et al., 2011), it is nonetheless certainly possible that we selected a group of topics on which conservatives are particularly likely to score high in complexity, thus offsetting the larger tendency for liberals to score higher. We acknowledge the possibility, as well as the possibility that our results are simply anomalous. But, in considering the scope of our research set against the existing body of work, it is also worth noting that most prior research on ideology and complexity is very narrow in its scope of possible topics, whereas our research covered 43 separate (though sometimes overlapping) topic stems for the student population and 15 separate topic categories for the Bush/Kerry comparison. For comparison, in the integrative complexity research cited in Jost et al. (2003), only one topic distinction is made within‐study at all, and it only occurred for one study and included only two broad topic types. Thus, although a lot of research indicates that liberals are higher than conservatives in complexity, it is unclear whether or not that research covers a wide range of topics. About integrative complexity specifically, it is further worth noting that prior research on ideology and integrative complexity has been mostly limited to scoring politicians (Jost et al., 2003; Van Hiel et al., 2010), and thus may not apply to the vast majority of the population.18 Further, our research covers over 2,000 participants, which is more participants than all the integrative complexity research combined cited in Jost et al.'s (2003) meta‐analysis (combined participant N for all integrative complexity studies = 307). So while it would be premature to suggest overturning all prior evidence on the basis of our work presented here, it would similarly be premature to dismiss our evidence as having no bearing on the larger question. We do not know yet whether our topic selection method might show bias in favor of conservatives, and our evidence contains the largest set of domains studied to date.19
We also compared correlations within each condition by the type of item (domain‐general versus domain‐specific). Removing the four domain‐general items from these domain‐specific scales increased the size of the difference between the religion and environmental dogmatism scales: The main conservatism measure was significantly negatively correlated for the environmental scale ( = –.36, < .001) and significantly positively correlated for the religion scale ( = .34, < .001; Fisher's ‐test for comparing correlations = 6.86, < .001). When looking at the four domain‐general items on the otherwise domain‐specific scales, conservatives were nonsignificantly positively correlated for the environmental scale ( = .10) and significantly positively correlated for the religion scale ( = .23, < .01; Fisher's ‐test for comparing correlations = 1.32, > .05). These results indicate that there is some “leakage” from the domain‐specific environmental items that reduce the typical size of the conservatism‐political ideology correlation but still reveal that the nature of the item itself does matter, even within a domain‐specific context. 5 Some prior research suggests that the relationship between ideology and outcome variables may be curvilinear and as such represents more about ideological extremism than about ideological content (e.g., Tetlock et al., 1994). As a result, we tested for the possibility that our results represent a curvilinear, rather than a linear, relationship. In particular, we ran linear regression on all key results while entering both a linear and two separate nonlinear terms for political conservatism as simultaneous predictors: (1) A mean‐centered quadratic term for conservatism and (2) an extremism score for conservatism (computed as the absolute difference from the midpoint of the conservatism scale). All analyses were performed within‐condition in a way parallel to that described above. Results overwhelmingly support a linear, rather than a nonlinear, interpretation of our results. For dogmatism, when linear and quadratic/extremism scores are entered simultaneously, all linear conservatism terms remained significant ( p 's < .01), while no significant nonlinear effects emerged in any condition on either nonlinear measurement ( p 's > .380). Thus, (1) all linear effects remained significant—and were of similar size and direction as in zero‐order analyses—when accounting for nonlinear effects, and (2) nonlinear effects overall accounted for very little of the variance. Thus, our results are much better construed as linear effects than as nonlinear.

Portions of the data from Studies 2 and 3 were used also to test hypotheses about psychological extremism (Conway et al., 7 This ad hoc strategy is primarily an organizing device to simplify data analyses and presentation. First, one of the most important considerations in the domain ideology × interaction is whether or not conservatives show an equal effect on their highest‐complexity topics as liberals do on their highest‐complexity topics. The ad hoc strategy we employ is useful for quickly illustrating that the nature of the interaction across topics is equal on both sides in a manner that allows for easy comparison across studies. Second, this strategy helps simplify additional analyses (e.g., it provides a straightforward way to test the effect of potential explanatory mechanisms in the “Additional Analyses of Studies 1–3” section). Although we recognize that this method has the potential of exaggerating the strength of the interaction effect, it is important to note that two of the three domain × ideology interaction terms are significant (Studies 2 and 4) without any ad hoc organizing—and the one that is not significant (Study 3) has such small cell numbers and so many topic domains that it would be hard to find an interaction term. Thus, we think this ad hoc method is constructive way of summarizing these studies that accurately captures the nature of the data.

As in prior research using this dataset (Conway et al., 2008 2011 2008 2011 r = .02, p > .70.
Although there are solid conceptual and practical reasons for treating liberalism/conservatism as a dichotomous variable, we ran several sets of additional analyses using conservatism as a continuous variable. First, we used regression/correlation analyses to test the key interactions from Studies 2 and 3 while keeping political conservatism as a continuous measurement. In particular, we (1) correlated political conservatism with complexity within each topic domain, (2) created an ad hoc dummy variable (−1 = liberals higher, +1 = conservatives higher) representing the top and bottom tertile for the conservatism‐complexity relationship, then (3) ran a regression entering standardized political conservatism, topic domain, and their interaction term on complexity. Results were consistent with those presented in the text for the categorical measurement of political conservatism: For both Study 2 and Study 3, there was no main effect of political conservatism ( = .01 and −.03), but a significant interaction between conservatism and topic domain ( > .12, 's <= .001). 10 For Studies 2 and 3, we further tested for curvilinear effects of conservatism in a manner identical to Study 1 by creating two nonlinear political conservatism terms. A summary of these results is that (1) the difference in the conservatism‐complexity relationship between conservative‐higher and liberal‐higher topics remains when accounting for nonlinear terms, (2) nonlinear effects overall accounted for a proportionally smaller amount of the variance than linear effects. In short, the effects reported here are better described as linear effects than curvilinear effects. A detailed report of these additional results is available upon request.

No significant interaction effects—and no clear pattern—emerged across the two studies on any of these variables. Finally, for Study 2 only, we had a measurement of the value pluralism participants felt relevant to the topic they wrote about (constructed in a manner drawn from Tetlock, 1986 2009 2009 p = .01), conservatism did not interact with topic type to predict value pluralism (interaction p > .89), and thus value pluralism cannot offer a clear explanation as to why topic type moderated the effect of conservatism on complexity.

In Studies 2 and 4, the effect was slightly stronger for topics on which conservatives were higher; for Study 3, the effect was slightly stronger for topics on which liberals were higher. However, across all three studies, Z‐ tests comparing the absolute value of these effect sizes revealed little evidence that they differed (Study 2 Z = 0.58; Study 3 Z = 0.54; Study 4 Z = 0.24; all p 's > .56). In other words, the absolute values of the ideology‐complexity effects are essentially equivalent between conservative‐higher and liberal‐higher topics in Studies 2, 3, and 4. This is consistent with the interpretation offered in the text.

As occurred for the dialectical complexity results reported in the text, no significant main effects for ideology on complexity occurred on integrative complexity in Studies 2–4. Also the same as for dialectical complexity, for Studies 2 and 3 for integrative complexity there was a significant main effect of topic domain. The main difference between integrative complexity and dialectical complexity results occurred in Studies 2 and 4 (recall that Study 3 did not have an initial ideology × domain interaction): Namely, the initial domain × ideology interactions (using all topic domains in those studies) were not significant for integrative complexity. However, following a similar ad hoc strategy for Studies 2, 3, and 4 using integrative complexity (as opposed to dialectical complexity) yielded significant interactions in each case (interaction p 's < .01), and the overall pattern is very similar. Also, Study 4 showed no main effect difference for topic domain for integrative complexity. Given our focus on dialectical forms of complexity throughout this article, these inferential differences are largely irrelevant. We report them here for completeness. Our larger point remains the same: For the dialectical forms of complexity most directly related to the rigidity of the right idea, the pattern presented here is better captured by domain ideology interactions than by a main effect of ideology.

Although attitude strength measurements did not show significant effects in those studies, they were in the correct direction and showed a similar pattern across both studies. We do not want to overinterpret these data; it is possible that this pattern does not represent a real finding. However, we view it as likely that a larger sample would find the expected significant effect for attitude strength.
The technological appeal of multiferroics is the ability to control magnetism with electric field1, 2, 3. For devices to be useful, such control must be achieved at room temperature. The only single-phase multiferroic material exhibiting unambiguous magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature is BiFeO3 (refs 4 and 5). Its weak ferromagnetism arises from the canting of the antiferromagnetically aligned spins by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction6, 7, 8, 9. Prior theory considered the symmetry of the thermodynamic ground state and concluded that direct 180-degree switching of the DM vector by the ferroelectric polarization was forbidden10, 11. Instead, we examined the kinetics of the switching process, something not considered previously in theoretical work10, 11, 12. Here we show a deterministic reversal of the DM vector and canted moment using an electric field at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that the switching kinetics favours a two-step switching process. In each step the DM vector and polarization are coupled and 180-degree deterministic switching of magnetization hence becomes possible, in agreement with experimental observation. We exploit this switching to demonstrate energy-efficient control of a spin-valve device at room temperature. The energy per unit area required is approximately an order of magnitude less than that needed for spin-transfer torque switching13, 14. Given that the DM interaction is fundamental to single-phase multiferroics and magnetoelectrics3, 9, our results suggest ways to engineer magnetoelectric switching and tailor technologically pertinent functionality for nanometre-scale, low-energy-consumption, non-volatile magnetoelectronics.NINTENDO Australia fears it could be swamped by requests for freebies after a cute story of goodwill went viral on the internet.
“Only a few goaltenders can be considered to be among the best of the best.” “Hundreds of goalies have laced up the skates, put on the mask, pads and blocker, and had the courage to get in front of the net with pucks coming right at them, with the shots sometimes topping 100 mph. Equipment or not, that’s no easy feat and isn’t cut out for everyone.” “Not only did each elite goalie make an impression, each left a legacy. Our game is so much better for them having played it. Each has raised the standard and helped change the perception about not only how critical but also how dominant goalies can be in the NHL.” “Each of these goalies left his stamp on the game. Now six Canadian goalies will be honored in a collection of Great Canadian Goalie stamps, which debuts Oct. 1.” “While I can’t tell you who the six will be, I’ll say this: Five of the six are in the Hall of Fame, four have won the Calder Trophy, and each has won the Stanley Cup (a combined 20 times). Not to mention two have won the Conn Smythe Trophy. That’s pretty impressive, so clearly each is deserving of the honor.” “The confidence that each of these men gave their respective teammates, coaches and fans while taking it away from the opposition is immeasurable. They were game-changers. They were Game Savers.”
Hacia el año 1997se quería poner linda para el jubileo del año 2000. Había plata y las tasas de interés estaban por el suelo.Se pusieron a invertir de tal manera que generaron un boom inmobiliario que hizo que el rancho se les llenara de albañiles turcos (que después se fueron a), africanos y de los países delHubo tal migración que surgió un problema: las putas europeas eran caras para los salarios de los obreros. Por cuanto ante ese desbalance comenzaron a migrar trolas de losque si bien habían dejado la guerra atrás la crisis los comía vivos.Las primeras prostitutas independientes que entraron fueron rumanas y búlgaras, las primeras víctimas de las mafias de trata de personas fueron las albanesas cuyo país aun estaba asediado por la guerra de exterminio.Así comenzó la última ola de trata de personas en Europa, que recién se pudo contener hacia 2005 cuando eldio por finalizada la existencia de mafias relacionadas al secuestro para alimentar el mercado de la prostitución.Una simple y bestial situación de oferta y demanda. Hay que considerar además que la demanda era de baja calidad. Por eso un campesino turco que se pasaba el día fratachando una catedral por 60 euros y dormía en un contenedor podía violarse a una pobre mujer drogada y a veces atada sin muchas vueltas al asunto.A la par del problema surgieron -cuándo no- estudiosos del fenómeno que fueron financiados para tranquilizar las culposas almas europeas. Esos estudios sobre trata de personas tenían su base europea en. Cuando se les acabó el curro de la trata de personas, psicólogos, sociólogos, politólogos y cualquier otra especialidad de esas que no generan nada productivo, descubrieron la "violencia de género", otro regalito que también exportamos oportunamente.La creencia de que enexisten redes al estilo de organizaciones mafiosas, con jerarquías y estructuras mafiosas relacionadas con la trata de personasCuando en realidad. Por cuanto, cuál sería el valor práctico de secuestrar mujeres para obligarlas a prostituirse, con el riesgo legal (bajo, es cierto) que eso conlleva y con, supongo, el disgusto de quienes consumen prostitutas, de tener que cogerse un cacho de carne drogado, atado a una cama. Porque si buscaran eso, me imagino, se cogerían a sus esposas en lugar de buscar prostitutas.El casolo vengo siguiendo desde antes de iniciado el juicio. Me leí el auto de procesamiento, la elevación a Juicio, la mayoría de las testimoniales y seguí vía web, on line, muchas de las audiencias claves. Lo que digo me da paja referenciarlo pero está ahí, googleen en formatos doc y pdf y aparecerán las actas, todo. Busquen en medios locales independientes, entren en los foros de esas provincias.Si creen o no, es cuestión de fe, la misma fe metafísica que tienen algunos en creer el cuentito de la mujer buenaza que salió a buscar a su hija y andaba luchando contra las mafias. Repiten como loritos que liberó 100, 300 mujeres. ¿De dónde sacan esas cifras? Todo verso.Si algo se notó desde el principio es que estábamos en presencia de un gran fraude. Fraude basado en la incorporación de testigos truchos, cuyos discursos se armaron en lacon el asesoramiento de dos abogadas más truchas que la propia Trimarco y que habían sido oportunamente ofrecidas porPor tanto, si quieren putear, puteen al fiscal de Juicio y a la Procuración (que son el verdadero brazo del Poder Político) y no a los jueces a los que les llegan las pruebas cocinadas y deben decidir sobre su veracidad. Principalmente en un caso en que, como se dijo no se pudo componer la prueba con documentales, ni nada. Sólo testimoniales.. La absolución era cantada. El aprovechamiento que se haga de ahora en más del caso, pertenece a otra dinámica pero el juicio tuvo su control de legalidad en los más de 10 abogados defensores. Desconozco la calidad de los jueces que intervinieron pero no hay que serpara estimar que son unos zaparrastrosos, corruptos e influenciables. Pero hay que admitir que hasta el más impresentable queda registrado para la posteridad en sus fallos, sobre todo cuando adquieren esta trascendencia.Imagínense qué burdo ha sido todo que hasta se habrán visto imposibilitados de condenar a esos zopencos para calmar al viejerío.En principio, la fiscalía de instrucción y luego la de juicio compusieron la prueba de la acusación sólo basada en testimoniales, cuestión de por sí ilegal, pero alcanzó para los procesamientos y creyeron que podía pasar en el Oral. Los testigos fueron aportados en su totalidad por Susana Trimarco. No investigaron nada. Es cierto que la primer fiscal intentó avanzar en otras pistas pero fue eyectada de la causa.De parte de la fiscalía, salvo una mujer, el resto de los testigos se encontraban o estuvieron alguna vez, asistidas financieramente por la, que a su vez es financiada por el Ministerio del Interior y antes por el de Justicia. Las asistencias van desde préstamos para microemprendimientos productivos, capacitación, vivienda y cualquier otro rubro que se les pueda ocurrir que es fácil chorearse la plata sin justificarla.¿De donde vinieron esas testigos? de los famosos operativos que realizaba la Trimarco desde 2007 en adelante.. La construcción del personaje de Susana Trimarco como una mujer valiente, que recorría el norte liberando esclavas fue generado por lade la delegación más poderosa que tiene la Secretaría de Inteligencia del Estado como es la de(donde además cobran sus dineros la piara de cibermilitantes que rompen las pelotas en las redes sociales luego de haberse desfinanciado el curro que les había armado).Por ejemplo, una mujer que declaró como testigo, al ser impugnada por encontrarse con un contrato de la Fundación Marita Verón, afirmó haber sido liberada de la esclavitud sexual en la que se encontraba por Susana Trimarco. Sin embargo se demostró que vivía a al menos cinco cuadras de ladonde había sido "liberada", que convivía con su marido y vecinos refirieron que diariamente llevaba a sus hijos al colegio. No fue imputada por falso testimonio.Como tampoco investigaron a otra "liberada" enuna tucumana que no pudo nombrar la calle que seguía a la que supuestamente estaba viviendo, no pudo decir de qué color era la Casa de Gobierno provincial (a pesar de domiciliarse a una cuadra del centro cívico), ni identificar datos de la terminal de ómnibus que teoricamente tomaba.Varias testigos afirmaron cobrar $3.000 mensuales de la Fundación por actividades que no pudieron precisar.El procedimiento era más o menos así. La SIDE identificaba algún puterío (que no perteneciera al Poder político), le pasaba el dato a la Trimarco y ésta, sola o acompañada a veces pory agentes de inteligencia, les caían encima.Te allanaban, entraban a las patadas y a los gritos, te tiraban todo el poder del Estado. Las pobres minas en bolas, medio en pedo, solas, pobres, alejadas de sus hijos, explotadas. Trimarco les ofrecía dinero, contratos, subsidios, etc. Imaginen qué iban a decir esas mujeres cuando se les pedía que dijeran que estaban secuestradas?Durante los últimos cuatro años, la fiscalía admitió esa calidad de testimonios para lograr la imputación a todo evento de los acusados, una banda de gordos impresentables que sus buenas cagadas se habrán mandado, pero coincidirán conmigo, amables lectores, que es insoportable pensar que se condene a alguien sin pruebas.Todo el andamiaje legal se basa en la confianza en que las condenas sean producto de pruebas admitidas y validadas en un juicio con garantías constitucionales. Porque podemos aceptar que un culpable se escape del cargo punitivo pero jamás que se condene a un inocente o a alguien que parezca culpable pero no se lo pueda demostrar.Bueno, algunos dirán que estos acusados eran culpables de otras cosas (por eso serán juzgados en La Rioja) o de la misma desaparición de Marita. Pero lo que nos diferencia de otras bestias es que tal vez algunos no queremos vivir en un país que condena sin pruebas y sin garantías.Pero la novelita de, ya había calado en el corazón de las viejas que se habían emocionado y llorado con la historia guionada.

Además, si algo de ingrata tiene la verdad (y la realidad) es que depende de las percepciones.El casoy toda la histeria que se observó en las Redes Sociales luego del veredicto ni siquiera sirve para elevar la conciencia crítica de las personas.

Cream or jam is fine.” So says 34-year-old Tingting He, in answer to the question of which to spread on the scone first in a British cream tea. It’s a relief to learn that I haven’t been doing the wrong thing all my life. We’re in the Essex tea room of an upmarket British jam maker and on the table before us is a plate of fluffy scones, a bowl of clotted cream and miniature jars of strawberry jam. Tingting may be Shanghainese but she’s giving me a lesson in the British tradition of afternoon tea. As brand ambassador for Tiptree Farm she delivers the same lecture in China’s top hotels. Her home country may claim to be a communist state, but it has a healthy appetite for the branding and rituals of the British ruling class. Tingting brings Chinese buyers for a tour of the Tiptree fruit farm.
It’s impossible to predict a timeframe for two-way peg sidechains at this point. Having said that, it seems clear that it will be easier to gain consensus around a sidechains-related proposal rather than something like an increase in the blocksize limit. Although there have been issues with making changes to Bitcoin Core in the past, Blockstream’s Adam Back seems somewhat optimistic about the prospects of implementing the two-way peg model in Bitcoin:Mars Observer was one of three NASA Mars missions lost in the 1990s because of technical errors, and not as part of a broader conspiracy. The dark side of space disaster theories Space disasters attract so much public attention and often involve such complex and subtle sequences of events that there’s an entire Internet literature of “crackpot causes” on par with JFK assassination myths. To the degree that innovative analysis is often critical to reconstructing—from partial and often garbled evidence—a shocking causal sequence leading from goodness to disaster, the initial investigation period demands that critical judgment be held somewhat in check so as not to discourage imagination. However, once a logical reconstruction gels, is tested, and then is ultimately verified by being implemented and hence reducing future flight hazards, that official explanation achieves a substantial level of authenticity. But not to everyone’s satisfaction, apparently, as a search of still-thriving non-traditional explanations of the Apollo 1 fire, the Apollo 13 breakdown, the Challenger disintegration, and the Columbia catastrophe, whose fifth anniversary now approaches. For example, in the case of Columbia, YouTube is full of videos from self-styled experts still convinced a freak bolt of ionospheric lightning crippled the spaceship. A famous photograph supposedly shows that bolt, even though space experts have long been satisfied that the bizarre image was merely the result of camera jiggle during a time-lapse exposure. Apart from the comic relief value of such crackpot ideas, there’s a darker aspect of this kind of cultural pathology, just as there are serious analyses pointing to the socially toxic effects of the JFK assassination “alternate theories”. For spaceflight, being distracted by the wrong cause means being tempted by the wrong fix. That’s never amusing, and often can be expensive. For spaceflight, being distracted by the wrong cause means being tempted by the wrong fix. That’s never amusing, and often can be expensive. As an egregious “bad example” of wrong causes, a recent book (Dark Mission, by Richard Hoagland and Michael Bara) spent a lot of time muddying the waters over a series of NASA Mars mission failures in the 1990s. This isn’t just some remote corner of an intellectual ghetto on the Internet—the book came within one tick mark of making it onto the New York Times bestsellers list for paperback non-fiction (it reached #21 nationwide). So as an exercise in cultural self-defense and in proselytizing sound “space safety” history, here is a detailed look at the claims, the delusions, and the errors in that book’s treatment of these space accidents. Mars Observer (1993) Dark Mission portrays the failure of the Mars Observer probe in 1993 as a deliberate act by NASA to prevent the publication of its expected photographs of artificial Martian ruins. But the description of the events is inconsistent with well-documented accounts, reports non-existent events, and omits well-known explanations for important features of the probe’s flight plan. All of this can be easily confirmed through Internet searches. Dark Mission, pp. 87–88: “NASA, in another unprecedented move, had inexplicably ordered Mars Observer to shut off its primary data stream prior to executing a key pre-orbital burn… Because NASA had violated the first rule of space travel—you never turn off the radio—no cause for the probe’s loss was ever satisfactorily determined.” Actually, whether a radio is turned on or off, practically all orbital insertion burns on lunar and planetary missions occur out of radio contact. This is a result of the geometric alignment of the probe passing behind the planet (or moon) and hence having its radio signals blocked. So keeping a probe’s radio turned on during these periods is about as useless as installing windshield wipers. To my knowledge, there is no “first rule of spaceflight” about never turning radios off. Interplanetary probes do this all the time. The “rule” is imaginary. I can’t find any documentation anywhere that provides this “rule”. I suspect that the Dark Mission authors just imagined it. The maneuver that Mars Observer was to perform was not even, as Dark Mission claims, a “key pre-orbital burn”. It was not a burn of any kind. Instead, it was the firing of explosive bolts to open two pressurant tanks that would allow the fuel to be pushed into the probe’s engines several days later. There is nothing “inexplicable” about turning off the radio for the firing of the pyrotechnic bolts. The sharp shock of the detonations was thought to be a hazard to the hot filament in a key radio component, which is much less brittle when cold. Hot filaments can shatter under shocks that cold ones wouldn’t even notice. This is clearly explained in on-ine documents, including the accident report. You only have to search “Mars Observer accident report” to be led right to the 313-page “Failure Investigation Board Report”. Keeping a probe’s radio turned on during orbit insertion burns is about as useless as installing windshield wipers. Why was the radio turned off? “In accordance with the mission’s published flight rules, the transmitter on the spacecraft had been turned off during the propellant-tank Pressurization Sequence on 21 August… To protect the spacecraft radio frequency transmitter from damage during the Pressurization Sequence (albeit a very low probability), the software included a command to turn off the Mars Observer transponder and radio frequency (RF) telemetry power amplifier for a period of ten minutes. This was a standard procedure that had been implemented several times earlier during the mission.” The report gave further details: “This sequence included the firing of two normally-closed pyrotechnic valves, that would allow high-pressure gaseous helium to pressurize the nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer tank and the monomethyl hydrazine fuel tank.” More on p. 25 of the report: “Concern existed in the Mars Observer project team that the pyro-firing event might damage the traveling wave tube amplifiers in the spacecraft telecommunications system if the amplifiers were left on.” Nor is it true that “no cause for the probe’s loss was ever satisfactorily determined”, as Dark Mission claims. To the contrary, in hindsight it was excruciatingly clear what almost certainly happened. “The Board was unable to find clear and conclusive evidence pointing to a particular scenario as the ‘smoking gun’,” the report explained, but “the Board concluded through a process of elimination that the most probable cause of the loss of downlink from the Mars Observer was a massive failure of the pressurization side of the propulsion system. The Board also concluded that the most probable cause of that failure was the unintended mixing of nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) in the titanium tubing on the pressurization side of the propulsion system. This mixing was believed by the Board to have been enabled by significant NTO migration through check valves during the eleven-month cruise phase from Earth to Mars. This conclusion is supported (but not proven) by NTO transport-rate data acquired by JPL, by NTO/MMH reaction simulations performed by [the Naval Research Laboratory], and by NTO/MMH mixing tests performed by AFPL [Air Force Propulsion Labs].” As to why the propulsions system hardware, adapted from a military prop module that normally needed a lifetime of only 12 hours, was used for a year-long mission, the report added that “Too much reliance was placed on the heritage of spacecraft hardware, software, and procedures, especially since the Mars Observer mission was fundamentally different from the missions of the satellites from which the heritage was derived.” It specifically criticized the propulsion system for “Inappropriate isolation mechanisms between fuel and oxidizer for an interplanetary mission.” “The original [money-saving] philosophy of minor modifications to a commercial production-line spacecraft was retained throughout the program,” the report continued. “The result was reliance on design and component heritage qualification that was inappropriate for the mission. Examples of this reliance were the failure to qualify the traveling wave tube amplifiers for pyro firing shock [and] the design of the propulsion system.” Whether or not this particular proposed failure mode is plausible (and from my own research I’ve concluded it was very plausible), it remains untrue to state (as Dark Mission does) that turning off the radio was “inexplicable” (and a violation of a “rule number one”) and that no satisfactory explanation for the failure was ever determined. Leaving out these easily-available views resulted in a passage that I think was incomplete and misleading. Mars Polar Lander (1999) I noted several Dark Mission references to me personally that deal with the 1999 failure of the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) probe. On page 316: “James Oberg published a story on UPI that accused JPL employees of knowing full well that the MPL was doomed (due to software problems related to the spacecraft’s landing legs) from very early on in the mission.” On page 317 this is called a “bizarre UPI accusation”. The brief account of the UPI article is garbled almost beyond recognition, casting serious doubts on the reading comprehension level of the author who did this section. In the one-sentence summary (“James Oberg published a story on UPI that accused JPL employees of knowing full well that the MPL was doomed due to software problems related to the spacecraft’s landing legs from very early on in the mission”), practically every word is wrong. Alleged foreknowledge of the impending failure had nothing to do with software. The article stated: As explained privately to UPI, the Mars Polar Lander vehicle’s braking thrusters had failed acceptance testing during its construction. But rather than begin an expensive and time-consuming redesign, an unnamed space official simply altered the conditions of the testing until the engine passed. “They tested the [engine] ignition process at a temperature much higher than it would be in flight,” UPI’s source said. This was done because when the [engines] were first tested at the low temperatures predicted after the long cruise from Earth to Mars, the ignition failed or was too unstable to be controlled. So the test conditions were changed in order to certify the engine performance. But the conditions then no longer represented those most likely to occur on the real space flight. “I’m as certain as I can be that the thing blew up,” the source concluded. That potential failure mode was not known “from very early on in the mission”, but only at the very end: “Following the September loss of the first spacecraft due to management errors, NASA had initiated a crash review of the Mars Polar Lander to identify any similar oversights. According to UPI’s source, the flaws in the [engine] testing were uncovered only a few days before the landing was to occur on December 3. By then it was too late to do anything about it.” The brief account of the UPI article is garbled almost beyond recognition, casting serious doubts on the reading comprehension level of the author who did this section. The specific software problem with the landing leg sensor scenario was not known before the landing at all, and the UPI article clearly states that it was discovered after the crash: “The Mars Polar Lander investigation team has also reportedly identified a second fatal design flaw that would have doomed the probe even if the engines had functioned properly. Post-accident tests have shown that when the legs are initially unfolded during the final descent, springs push them so hard that they ‘bounce’ and trigger the microswitches by accident. As a result, the computer receives what it believes are indications of a successful touchdown, and it shuts off the engines. Ground testing prior to launch apparently never detected this because each of the tests was performed in isolation from other tests. One team verified that the legs unfolded properly. Another team verified that the microswitches functioned on landing.” In a simple reading comprehension verification test, this one incident indicates a severe problem with the book’s authors’ ability to understand, and restate, simple English about space technology. In one sentence, there were three swings, and three misses—three strikes. By the way, after NASA’s official denunciations of the UPI story I had written (I have the honor of being the only journalist ever denounced by name in an official NASA press release), the story turned out even worse than I had written. Space engineers hadn’t fudged the test results, after all. My source was wrong about this, this time, the first occasion in a long sequence of accurate leaks. What was far worse was that NASA had decided that any such tests weren’t even necessary. The engine ignition system was never tested at temperatures expected out at Mars, because (JPL said) the engine had already flown in space on some other mission and so didn’t need to be requalified. But NASA press officials, despite repeated inquiries from me and promises of cooperation from them, never disclosed the space mission(s) that these special engines had been originally flown on. The same design engines are installed aboard the Mars Phoenix lander now on route. Hopefully, improvements have been made. page 2: Mars Climate Orbiter >>The birth of the Traveling Wilburys was a happy accident. Warner Bros. Records’ International Department had asked that George Harrison come up with a B-side for “This Is Love,” a single from his Cloud Nine album.

Prosecutors meted out a special kind of justice for Jeffrey Epstein, larded with fawning obsequiousness, secret dealings and an astoundingly lenient sentence. After all, billionaires -- even billionaire sex abusers -- aren't like you and me. Investigators documented that at least 34 underage girls, some as young as 13, were repeatedly exploited by Epstein and his buddies for their carnal amusement at his Palm Beach mansion from 1999 to 2007. According to court documents, the girls were required to administer "topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself." Occasionally, "the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse." State and federal prosecutors happily reduced what amounted to hundreds of federal and state sex crimes to two state charges -- soliciting prostitution and procuring a person younger than 18 for prostitution. Meanwhile, the feds not only promised not to ring him up on federal charges, they granted immunity to his various co-conspirators. The federal prosecutors -- who seemed cowed by Epstein's high powered attorneys, including Roy Black, Kenneth Starr and Alan Dershowitz -- worked out the secret plea deal without bothering to inform victims that their abuser would be spared federal charges. The failure to notify the victims has been at the crux of a federal lawsuit filed in West Palm Beach against the U.S. attorney's office in 2008 by two of the young women, identified as Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2. On Wednesday, their attorneys filed a 57-page motion demanding a summary judgment in their favor. Whether or not, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra grants the motion, the document (along with the scores of attachments containing nearly apologetic emails and letters from prosecutors to Epstein's legal team) sure as hell prove that billionaires are treated with special deference in the U.S. justice system. The correspondence shows prosecutors trying mightily to contrive a sweet plea deal that could be finalized before the victims or the media got wind of it. One exchange suggested that he plead guilty in Miami, "which would hopefully cut the press coverage significantly." No wonder. Epstein received a piddling 18-month sentence for a crime that got less exalted sex offenders in Florida 10 or 15 years hard time. His less-than-hard-time amounted to 13 months in the Palm Beach County stockade. Except he was allowed to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week at his nicely appointed office as part of a work-release program. He then served the balance of his sentence under house arrest -- quite an imposition for someone with a luxury mansion on the barrier island. Consider that this occurred at a time when low-rent sex offenders were forced to live like apocalyptic trolls beneath Miami's Julia Tuttle Causeway without water, toilets, electricity. Of course, super rich Epstein, 62, managed to avoid such indignities. Nowadays, the convict is occasionally featured in tabloid photos, snapped as he flits about New York in the company of young, beautiful women. Justice -- the special justice for billionaires -- has been served. [The Miami Herald Feb 12, 2016] 2015: * Justin Bieber Hires High-Powered Lawyer Roy Black in DUI Case: Justin Bieber is bringing in the big guns in a bid to beat his DUI charge. The singer, who was arrested in Miami early Thursday morning for DUI and drag-racing, has hired high-powered lawyer Roy Black to represent him. Black, who is married to Real Housewives of Miami star Lea Black, is a civil and criminal defense trail attorney best known for getting Kennedy family member William Kennedy Smith acquitted of charges of rape in 1991. He has also represented Kelsey Grammer, race car driver Helio Castroneves, Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis and conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh. The 19-year-old pop star, who is Canadian, is being charged with DUI, driving without a valid driver's license out of the state of Georgia and resisting arrest without violence. The police say Bieber admitted that he had consumed alcohol, had been smoking marijuana and had taken prescription medication. [People; Jan 23, 2015<http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20779032,00.html>] * JEFFREY EPSTEIN ATTORNEY ROY BLACK DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN LETTER BY EX-U.S. ATTORNEY ALEXANDER ACOSTA Attorney Roy Black is disputing claims that he, and other attorneys representing Jeffrey Epstein, pried into federal prosecutors' personal lives in attempting to disqualify them from investigating the billionaire sex offender. Black also denies Epstein's attorneys "negotiated in bad faith," while attempting to reach an agreement with federal prosecutors. In a written response Tuesday to the Palm Beach Daily News, Black disputes claims made against Epstein's defense team by former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta. Those and other allegations by Acosta were contained in a three-page letter printed Friday in the online publication The Daily Beast. Acosta was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time Epstein was being investigated on federal charges related to multiple sex crimes with minor girls. Black, the Miami attorney who successfully defended William Kennedy Smith against rape charges, was part of Epstein's legal dream team. Epstein was never charged with a federal crime. He and his attorneys struck a deal with federal prosecutors, which was outlined in a non-prosecution agreement. According to the agreement, Epstein had to plead guilty to two state charges, register as a lifelong sex offender and serve 18 months in jail. If he successfully completed those terms and served one-year of probation, then Epstein would not be prosecuted on federal charges as they related to approximately 30 to 40 victims. In a written response to the Daily News, Black said, "We did present argument after argument why a proposed federal prosecution against Mr. Epstein was unsupported by the evidence. We detailed the so-called evidence during many meetings with prosecutors and agents. "We were quite candid in disclosing all the evidence we had gathered in our investigation and I believe we made a convincing case why charges were not appropriate. I still believe that today." According to Acosta, now dean of the Florida International University College of Law, federal prosecutors and agents met with Black in the summer of 2007. The prosecutors presented Epstein a choice: plead guilty to state felony charges resulting in two years imprisonment, registration as a sex offender and restitution for the victims or prepare for a federal felony trial. What followed, Acosta said, was that Epstein's defense team launched "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors. "I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," Acosta said in his letter. Among the "legal superstars" on Epstein's defense team: Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, Kenneth Starr, Jay Lefkowitz and several others, including prosecutors who had formally worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office and in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Justice Department. Acosta said that one member of the defense team warned him "the office's excess zeal in forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to proceed with this matter." Black said he's never heard anyone mention writing a book about the Epstein case. "Mr. Acosta claims we negotiated in bad faith by appealing to the Department of Justice in Washington," Black said. "Any person under investigation by a United States attorney, meaning any of the 94 such offices in the country, has the right to seek review by the Department of Justice and it is so provided for in their manual. Thus I cannot imagine invoking this right could be construed as bad faith. "In our system of justice, people are given the right of appeal and there should be no implication of wrong doing by exercising it. "Finally Mr. Acosta mentions we looked for personal peccadilloes of prosecutors," Black said. "I am not sure what he refers to but this never happened. We did point out misconduct and over-reaching by certain people involved in the investigation. Not only is there nothing wrong with this but it is a necessary part of the process. There will always be people who abuse the great power of the government and we can not stand by silently when it occurs." The non-prosecution agreement was sealed in Epstein's state felony file until victims' attorneys successfully argued to make the document public in September 2009.

Murphy, the Democratic congressional candidate hoping to unseat U.S. Rep. Allen West, has opened himself up to a lot of bad jokes with the fundraiser slated for tomorrow night in Coral Gables. The event is being held at the home of Roy Black, the famed criminal attorney who defended Rush Limbaugh when Palm Beach prosecutors accused him of "doctor-shopping" for pain pills. Black is currently representing John Goodman, the Wellington polo mogul accused of driving drunk and causing a car accident that killed a 23-year-old last year. Guests at Black's home will shell out $500 to $5,000 for the soiree. They'll also get to rub shoulders with a genuine celebrity: Black's wife, Lea, who has been a cast member on The Real Housewives of Miami. Just to recap: Republican Allen West defends tax breaks for the wealthy, and Democrat Patrick Murphy holds a fundraiser at the home of a famous criminal lawyer and a reality-TV star. Ain't politics grand? [Broward/Palm Beach New Times-December 6th , 2011 http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2011/12/rush_limbaugh_attorney_roy_black_fundraiser_patrick_murphy.php] * LET'S GET DRUNK: ROY BLACK, POLO BOSS JOHN GOODMAN'S LAWYER; HOSTS YEARLY SHINDIG "International Polo Club Palm Beach founder John Goodman, whose alleged killing of a 23-year-old man in a car crash last month is still under investigation, was nowhere to be found among those who paid homage to high-profile South Florida attorney Roy Black. Funny thing, because when it comes to celebrities attending The Blacks' Annual Gala in Miami Beach Saturday night, Black and his wife Lea can always count on those he extracted from the criminal justice system. And yes, there may be some of future clients of Black's there, too. Girls Gone Wild's Joe Francis was one of them. He once had tax and public morals problems, but Black made it all better. So he came to the Fontainebleau Miami Beach for the big party. "He wins every case," Francis said. "His approach is different from other lawyers, partly because he never worked for the government as a prosecutor. He believes in your case 100 percent, and I don't know any other who does that." Three-time Indianapolis and Dancing With The Stars winner Helio Castroneves showed up. Black got him out of his little tax evasion issue last year. Yet John Goodman, who could soon be facing DUI and manslaughter accusations but hasn't been charged, was MIA. And who could blame him? Roy Black, after all, kicked off the open bar, three-course fiesta with this announcement to the 1,000-plus guests who'd paid up to $1,000 each: "If you guys don't get drunk and dance on the tables, then this party has failed!" The Blacks party, which could rival most Palm Beach shindigs in the wealth and notoriety of participants, has long been a staple of Miami's social life. And it raises millions for educational charities. It gathers usually well-known figures from all facets of life. The legal community, for example, was represented with the likes of Harvard prof Alan Dershowitz, who represented Palm Beach millionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein with Black; O.J. Simpson prosecutor Marcia Clark, unrecognizable after years of plastic surgery; and Jim Ferrara, a successful local litigation attorney. Also there: rapper Rick Ross; shoe designer Lisa Pliner; TV chefs Ron Duprat and Bobby Flay; The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Kim Zolciak; poker star Noah Schwartz; Bob Seger saxophonist Alto Reed; Gov. Charlie Crist and his lovely bride, Carole Crist; singers Natalie Cole, Paulina Rubio and Gloria Estefan; boxer Lennox Lewis; former Miami Heat star Alonzo Mourning; Girls Gone Wild's Joe Francis; and others. (See them all by clicking here or on the photos) Gov. Charlie Crist, who's running for U.S. Senate, was received like a rock star. Despite the polls showing he's behind Marco Rubio among Republicans, Crist pressed the flesh with a vengeance and showed he's still popular among the beautiful people. And despite stories saying that his wife of a little more than a year is nowhere to be found, the First Lady was glued to her husband. "He's a brilliant attorney who has extraordinary admiration of a lot of people," the governor said of Black. "He's a hard worker, and those usually get lucky." Well, there was one failure that night: the Blacks couldn't auction off a Bugatti Veyron, the world's most expensive car. But then, who in this economy could get someone to bid $2.75 million on anything?

Ian resides in Limehouse, where he has also lived with his former long-time partner Sean Mathias. The two men have also worked together on the film Bent (1997) as well as in acclaimed stage productions. To this day, McKellen works mostly in theater, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990 for his efforts in the arts. However, he has managed to make several quite successful forays into film. He has appeared in several productions of Shakespeare's works including his well received Richard III (1995), and in a variety of other movies. However, it has only been recently that his star has finally begun to shine in the eyes of North American audiences. Roles in various films, Cold Comfort Farm (1995), Apt Pupil (1998) and Gods and Monsters (1998), riveted audiences. The latter, in particular, created a sensation in Hollywood, and McKellen's role garnered him several of awards and nominations, including a Golden Globe and an Oscar nod. McKellen, as he continues to work extensively on stage, he always keeps on 'solidifying' his 'role' as Laurence Olivier's worthy 'successor' in the best sense too, such as _King Lear (2008)_ directed by Trevor Nunn and in a range of other staggering performances full of generously euphoric delight that have included "Peter Pan" and Noël Coward's "Present Laughter", as well as Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot" and Harold Pinter's "No Man's Land", both in acclaimed productions brilliantly directed by Sean Mathias.
The first thing to note about Collusion is that most of it is padding. That is to say, that it consists mainly of a lot of digressions in which Harding describes people and events not directly related to the main story of collusion. Whenever a new character is introduced, you tend to get pages of background information, along with descriptions of various places they’ve been to, things they’ve done in the past, and so on. At the start of the book, for instance, Harding introduces Christopher Steele, who prepared an infamous dossier purportedly based on secret sources within the Kremlin, which made all sort of extreme accusations against Trump. We learn about Steele’s parents, his childhood, his education, his career, and so on. Harding recounts how he met Steele. We learn about how they tried one café, then another, who drank what, etc, etc. This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the book. There’s a lot of padding. This padding makes Collusion an easy read, and gives it colour, and the flavour of a spy novel. But none of it adds anything to our knowledge of Donald Trump and his relationship with Russia. It’s just filler, designed to cover up the fact that, when it comes to the matter of collusion, Harding doesn’t have a whole lot new to say and certainly doesn’t have enough to fill up an entire book.

The woman in the video is described as white, between five-foot-two and five-foot-five, with a thin build and brown hair.Well, that reality stands true even today. Kejriwal is still the leader of a city (which lusts for free bijli, paani, and wi-fi), and the recent revolts within AAP, and all that dirty linen being washed out openly in public by AAP, shows his sheer inability to take everyone together. That is precisely why Shanti Bhushan said that he lacks organizational ability and should not be a Chief Minister. His prophecy is becoming true within the very forst month. Just ten days after Kejriwal boastfully sermonized to others that AAP workers should not have 'ahankaar' (while at the same time branding BJP and Congress as 'ahankaari' parties), it comes out that the most 'ahankaari' guy in AAP is he himself as he cannot tolerate any other founder member in AAP attaining some status within the party. When AAP's own pet 'Lokpal' pointed out the one-man-one-post rule being violated by Kejriwal, and objected to his holding dual posts, he was brushed aside by Kejriwal and his coterie. What does this show? It only shows that all that talk of Jan Lokpal by Kejriwal and his coterie was a plain bluff to milk Anna Hazare's ideals to gain power in Delhi. Can someone who brazenly insults own party Lokpal ever be trusted to work towards a national Jan Lokpal?Following a monster sophomore campaign at Cartersville High School in Georgia that saw him pass for 3,655 yards and 43 touchdowns, Trevor Lawrence keeps his spot as the No. 1 player in the nation and headlines Thursday’s unveiling of the first full Top247 for the 2018 class.
CLICK HERE FOR THE TOP247!John Schnatter, the founder and CEO of nationwide pizza chain Papa John's, traveled to Tennessee this past weekend to attend the funeral of an employee who had been shot and killed during a store robbery.Gordon Schaffer, 22, was working the late shift at the Papa John's location in Columbia, Tennessee on October 21 when armed robbers entered the restaurant and ordered Schaffer to empty the cash register. Schaffer complied, but was shot by one of the suspects, and died before medics could transport him to a hospital.Schaffer's funeral was held on October 25 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, and was attended by family and friends with the Papa John's CEO making an unexpected appearance."We never once imagined that this would touch anyone high up in the Papa John's corporate office, let alone, John Schnatter. He was visibly distraught when speaking to my family about the tragic loss of my brother and it was apparent that he didn't come just to pay lip service," Devan Cronin, Schaffer's oldest sister, wrote on Facebook.Papa John's also covered the expenses of Schaffer's funeral and medical costs. Darious A. Fitzpatrick was arrested on Wednesday for killing Schaffer, and also faces charges related to the robberies of two Dollar General stores earlier in October, according to News 2 ABC Nashville.In November, a University of Michigan student reported that a white male threatened to burn her alive unless she took off her hijab, a head covering worn by some practicing Muslim women.
Visual designers are the ones responsible for the way an app looks. UX designers, meanwhile, are the ones who concentrate on how it feels. A lot of times, designers do both, but going forward, jobs that require just visual design skills are going to die out. That’s according to Charles Fulford, Executive Creative Director of Elephant, the San Francisco-based, Apple-centric stealth arm of the digital agency Huge. “Gone are the days of UX dumping a ton of wireframes on visual designers,” he says, as well as “the days of visual designers being clueless about usability.” What are needed instead are designers who can not only come up with the look of an idea, but make it real, with actual programming and prototyping skills. Rob Girling, cofounder of the design consultancy Artefact, agrees. “In the next 10 years, all visual design jobs will start to be augmented by algorithmic visual approaches,” he says. After all, design companies are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to create previously impossible algorithmic designs, as well as crunch UX data on millions of users. “An AI-powered tool can automatically provide a designer with 100 variations of a layout, based on some high-level template, or style definition . . . We see early versions of these algorithmic procedurally generated tools already in use by game designers.” For example, the 17 billion planet universe in the recent blockbuster video game No Man’s Sky was largely generated algorithmically. The short version? If you’re a visual designer, it’s time to diversify.
Yvonne Lin of 4B Collective believes that in the near future, there will be a growing need for designers who can work in and across different types of materials. For example, she sees bamboo architects as being an up-and-coming design field, as the Western world embraces “the possibilities of a weight-bearing material that can grow three feet in 24 hours and can be bent, laminated, joined, and stripped,” as Asia has. She also says that designers who can sew will soon be in hot demand to create structural soft goods. What’s a structural soft good? Think of the kind of things MIT’s Neri Oxman designs, or wearables that are as much tech as textile: a blend of circuit boards and fabrics, like Google’s Project Jacquard. “Today, there is a skill and knowledge gap between the soft- and hard-good world. Very few people know how to work in both,” she says. “The intelligent mixing of fabrics (for comfort) and plastics and metals (for structure and function) would have significant benefits for health care and sports products. As people live longer and as sports participation increases the demand for these more comfortable and higher performance products will increase.” Maybe even tomorrow’s Air McFlys.

Yet that’s the last thing schools are apt to do. What we have seen instead over the past forty years, in addition to the raising of a reserve army of contingent labor, is a kind of administrative elephantiasis, an explosion in the number of people working at colleges and universities who aren’t faculty, full-time or part-time, of any kind. From 1976 to 2001, the number of nonfaculty professionals ballooned nearly 240 percent, growing more than three times as fast as the faculty. Coaching staffs and salaries have grown without limit; athletic departments are virtually separate colleges within universities now, competing (successfully) with academics. The size of presidential salaries—more than $1 million in several dozen cases—has become notorious. Nor is it only the presidents; the next six most highly paid administrative officers at Yale averaged over $430,000 in 2007. As Gaye Tuchman explains in Wannabe U (2009), a case study in the sorrows of academic corporatization, deans, provosts and presidents are no longer professors who cycle through administrative duties and then return to teaching and research. Instead, they have become a separate stratum of managerial careerists, jumping from job to job and organization to organization like any other executive: isolated from the faculty and its values, loyal to an ethos of short-term expansion, and trading in the business blather of measurability, revenue streams, mission statements and the like. They do not have the long-term health of their institutions at heart. They want to pump up the stock price (i.e., U.S. News and World Report ranking) and move on to the next fat post.
But now those prerogatives are also under threat. I am not joining the call for the abolition of tenure—a chorus that includes two of last year’s most widely noticed books on the problems of America’s colleges and universities, Higher Education?, by Andrew Hacker and Claudia Dreifus, and Crisis on Campus, by Mark Taylor. Tenure certainly has its problems. It crowds out opportunities for young scholars and allows academic deadwood to accumulate on the faculty rolls. But getting rid of it would be like curing arteriosclerosis by shooting the patient. For one thing, it would remove the last incentive for any sane person to enter the profession. People still put up with everything they have to endure as graduate students and junior professors for the sake of a shot at that golden prize, and now you’re going to take away the prize? No, it is not good for so many of academia’s rewards to be backloaded into a single moment of occupational transfiguration, one that sits like a mirage at the end of twelve or fifteen years of Sinaitic wandering. Yes, the job market would eventually rebalance itself if the profession moved, say, to a system of seven-year contracts, as Taylor suggests. But long before it did, we would lose a generation of talent.
Nor should we pooh-pooh the threat the abolition of tenure would pose to academic freedom, as Hacker and Dreifus do. “We have scoured all the sources we could find,” they write, “yet we could not find any academic research whose findings led to terminating the jobs of college faculty members.” Yes, because of tenure. If deans and trustees and alumni and politicians rarely even try to have professors fired, that is precisely because they know they have so little chance of making it happen. Before tenure existed, arbitrary dismissals were common. Can you imagine what the current gang of newly elected state legislators would do if they could get their hands on the people who teach at public universities? (Just look at what happened to William Cronon, the University of Wisconsin historian whose e-mails were demanded by the state Republican Party after he exposed the role of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Governor Scott Walker’s attack on public employee unions.) Hacker and Dreifus, who recognize the importance of academic freedom, call instead of tenure for presidents and trustees with “backbone” (a species as wonderful as the unicorn, and almost as numerous). Sure, and as long as the king is a good man, we don’t need democracy. Academics play a special role in society: they tell us things we don’t want to hear—about global warming, or the historical Jesus, or the way we raise our children. That’s why they need to have special protections.
So where’s the money supposed to come from? It’s the same question we ask about the federal budget, and the answer is the same. We’re still a very wealthy country. There’s plenty of money, if we spend it on the right things. Just as we need to wrestle with the $700 billion gorilla of defense, so do universities need to take on administrative edema and extracurricular spending. We can start with presidential salaries. Universities, like corporations, claim they need to pay the going rate for top talent. The argument is not only dubious—whom exactly are they competing with for the services of these managerial titans, aside from one another?—it is beside the point. Academia is not supposed to be a place to get rich. If your ego can’t survive on less than $200,000 a year (on top of the prestige of a university presidency), you need to find another line of work. Once, there were academic leaders who put themselves forward as champions of social progress: people like Woodrow Wilson at Princeton in the 1900s; James Conant at Harvard in the 1940s; and Kingman Brewster at Yale, Clark Kerr at the University of California and Theodore Hesburgh at Notre Dame in the 1960s. What a statement it would make if the Ivy League presidents got together and announced that they were going to take an immediate 75 percent pay cut. What a way to restore academia’s moral prestige and demonstrate some leadership again.
While the Closed Beta has expanded in features and some content in the last year, most of our artists have been working on Act Three. We expect that Path of Exile will enter Open Beta in mid-August. At that point our final character wipe will occur and the game will be permanently available for everyone to play.Once we enter Open Beta, we will stop selling the current set of Supporter Packs and will instead offer other options for purchasing micro-transaction credit. If you want to buy a Kiwi pet, you will need to do so while Path of Exile is still in Closed Beta.Many people who have supported Path of Exile financially will receive physical goods posted to them (such as t-shirts, posters, copies of the game and soundtrack). We are about to start preparing these and we expect that they will be printed and posted before August.A few months ago, we stated that we hoped to enter Open Beta in June. Some of the crucial features that we must enter Open Beta with are not yet finished, so we will delay the Open Beta until they are. As mentioned above, we expect that this will be mid-August. While we strongly believe that this estimate is accurate, we will update it over time if work progresses ahead or behind of schedule.One of the advantages of not having a publisher is that we are able to create our own deadlines without being forced to open up the game to the public in an unfinished state. While I am sure that many of our patient fans are disappointed by this announcement, please rest assured that the game is almost done - lucky testers (and our generous supporters) have been playing the Closed Beta for ten months and can hopefully attest to our high quality standards.Here's the plan for the last remaining patches before Open Beta. The patches will take approximately three weeks each, and will be available to Alpha testers a week before they are deployed to the Beta realm.: Will be deployed Tuesday, June 5. I've discussed its contents here : Among other changes, this patch will enable the new end-game (which we have been hinting at for a while) and the Act Two final boss. It will include the ability to swap between weapon sets.: This patch will fix most of the issues with Minions. It will also introduce PvP arenas and the ability to challenge other players to duel. We expect to improve the Brutus fight in this patch as well.: A secure trade screen and substantial update to server stability and capacity is scheduled for this patch.: The official Open Beta release, which we expect will be deployed a week or so after 0.9.13. It will have Act Three enabled, voice acting for most of the NPCs and characters, as well as a range of cosmetic micro-transactions to purchase.There are hundreds of minor bug fixes and small features such as additional skill gems and monsters scheduled during the above timeline as well, but they are too small to individually list here.While the Closed Beta has expanded in features and some content in the last year, most of our artists have been working on Act Three. Here's a teaser of some of their recent work. YouTube |
I was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. At the age of 8 years old I was baptized into the church and confirmed as a member. I wasn’t the most obedient, but for the most part I did what was expected of me. But then, at the age of 15 I began to question the doctrines that I had been taught since before I could even speak. I believed, as the church taught, that if I did what I was supposed to it would all be clear to me. I though that this doubt was coming from the devil. I believed that because I was dating when I shouldn’t have been, I let him into my life and allowed him to leave me astray. This doubt continued off and on for two years. After breaking up with my boyfriend, I was sure that I would gain clarity. I was doing what the Lord wanted me to do, he would bless me with the truth. But this never came. I began to google what I had been taught all my life was “anti-mormon” but when I did so, I was plagued with guilt. I would read for five minutes, exit out and delete my browser history. I continued as if I hadn’t read anything at all. I went to seminary, sacrament meeting, mutual, etc.. At this time in my life, guilt and confusion filled me.
It wasn’t until I left for school that I really started to look into what I had been taught my whole life. I visited mormonthink.com and /r/exmormon. I read the CES Letter. I stopped going to institute and Sunday meetings. I started to realize that what I grew up believing, was a con. The guilt and confusion I’d been feeling for the past 3 years floated away. That left room for anger, sadness, and worry. Initially, I was furious. I was partially angry at myself for being fooled, but mostly at the LDS church for fooling me and millions of others. I was devastated, I wanted so much to hold on to the church and its teachings. I wanted my dream of being married in the temple, because what girl doesn’t want to be married inside of a castle? At first, it scared me to realize that everything I thought I knew about life, was now a mystery to me. But most of all I was, and still am, worried. I know have a huge weight on my shoulders that will not be lifted until I tell my family of my disaffection. There is no doubt in my mind that they will not understand. They will believe that I have left because I want to “be of the world” and that I just want to sin. They will view me as weak for not having the kind of strength that is required to look past the things that led me away. I can’t blame them though… Four years ago I would have thought the same thing.
One night in the mid-80s, I was sitting on my ratty couch in my one-bedroom apartment in Peoria, Illinois. I had smoked a lot of pot and drank a bunch of beer and Larry King was on the television with the sound muted. My stereo was blaring “Won’t Get Fooled Again” by the Who. I remember feeling great pity for poor Pete Townshend. Someone had fooled him and I wondered who would do such a mean thing to that big-beaked guitarist. While pondering this thought, I absent-mindedly glanced at my 14-inch Panasonic color television set with real plastic wood-grain on the sides, and I saw that Larry’s guest for the evening was Jay Leno. Now this was way before Leno became the host of The Tonight Show. This is back when he used to do bits on the David Letterman’s show when Letterman was on NBC. I thought he was pretty funny back then and so I turned the Who off and turned up the volume. Larry King was speaking. “Our guest tonight is funnyman Jay Leno. If you have a question for Jay call the number below,” Larry croaked out in that old-man, froggy voice of his. As I looked at the number at the bottom of the screen, all of the sudden I had a desperate urge to call the show, so I scribbled it on a well-worn one-dollar bill that I yanked from my pocket, as a tampon commercial came on the air. Brenda Vaccaro’s deep mannish voice extolled the wonders of Playtex tampons, and I tried to think of a good question for Jay Leno.
So, this is basically my favorite game on the vita!I made this save editor today.(It's in C#, I have never used that before, I'll put the source up on github later when it is cleaner and updated a bit more, don't worry.)Windows only, never thought I would do this, sorry!I want to add inventory/storage editing.I can already do simple stuff, like changing amounts, good for the dlc exp boosts(I will see if I can inject the dlc exp boosts to the save without needing to buy them)We can do cool stuff like having 255 scapedolls (I guess more, it's 16bit), instead of the normal max of 5.When I set scapedolls to FFFF, it didn't get used upon death, so that wasn't good.But stuff like monomates, if you set to FFFF, you can still use them (and the value won't even go down to FFFE)If anyone can have a look at items, how they are stored in the save, please shareI think items are stored in 16 bytes, but I might be wrong.I assumed monomates, dimates, trimates would be together in memory, but no they are spread out... strange.I can edit stuff like gran arts/technique levels, but I will add this stuff to the editor later.Any bugs etc, please tell me.EnjoyDoug Mataconis · · 7 comments
The thing that really brought it home was a video. It looked like a traffic cam, but it was much better quality than that, so Thomas thought perhaps it was one of those static cameras that TV stations cut to during commercial breaks. It showed a crowded pedestrian crosswalk somewhere in Asia. It was evening in America, which meant that it was early morning in China; people were going to work. One moment the mass of people were crossing the street, the next they were accelerating toward the sky. It was almost exactly what the Rapture was supposed to look like, at least in the movies and television shows that Thomas had seen. There was nothing peaceful about it though; these people were falling, their mouths open in screams that the camera's microphone wasn’t close enough to pick up. It only took a small slice of time for the crosswalks to be devoid of people. That was when Thomas saw the cars; there were people inside them, pressed up against the roofs. A few of the cars started to idle forward, heading towards collisions that their drivers weren't in control enough to stop. That was where the video cut out.
And for those who missed the feverishly hyped visit from Paul at the Egyptian, Bushmill's whiskey produced this video documenting it. The whiskey company sponsored his trip to the City of Trees, as Paul refers to Boise. In the video Paul sips whiskey with some friends and talks about his Idaho roots -- and "staying grounded" in Hollywood.Don't start thinking that landing a rocket's first stage is routine just yet, as SpaceX has just posted video of its latest attempt. The Falcon 9 rocket successfully delivered two satellites to orbit, however when it returned to Earth everything did not go exactly to plan. The live video feed cut out so we weren't sure exactly what happened, but now Elon Musk has tweeted video from afar showing the landing process. According to Musk, one of the engines cut out before it hit the deck of the droneship, causing a landing hard enough to "destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines." We're guessing there's not enough left for this one to join the trophy case, but that's just how it happens in 2016, which Musk is calling "the year of experimentation."B. Sherwood Lollar et al.

No recovery time! No pain! No blood! No dilation! No bandages and packing! No long, tedious four year process for hormones to do their breast development, skin tone, body hair, fat redistribution thing. No irritating legal hassles with changing name and documentation. No emotional roller-coaster. No spontaneous bursts of tears. No voice training. No re-learning your body language and mannerisms. No anxiety about passing. No joyful revelation the first time you realize you are passing. No crying with happiness the first time you discover you can look in a mirror without hating what you see. No dealing with the scariness and awkwardness of beginning to date again. No re-learning the entire language of fashion and how to dress. No getting accustomed to bras and heels and earrings and annoying nightmarishly fiddly little jewelry clasps. No wondering whether the better orgasms are worth their infrequency. No rediscovering your sexuality. No long, complex process of reacquainting yourself with new genitalia and learning to understand them. No learning what you are and aren’t comfortable wearing. No getting nail polish all over your fingers and eyeliner in your eyeball because you never got a chance to learn how to do that stuff as a little girl. No coming out. No losing friends. No being disowned by family. No growing closer to the people who supported you. No adapting to the loss of male privilege and learning how to deal with cat calls. No nothing.
No. That’s a lovely idea, it is, and thank you. I do appreciate the sentiment and we often enjoy hearing that kind of thing. It’s an enormously tempting idea, too, and hard to give up. It would be terrific to believe that I’m this wonderfully brave, courageous, strong woman who overcame unimaginable odds to assert her true self without compromise to a hostile, bigoted world. But it just isn’t true. We aren’t brave. We’re scared shitless and in tremendous pain and desperate for a way out, and don’t really have much of a choice. Imagine you’re being chased by a pack of snarling wolves through a darkened, stormy forest. They’re nipping at your heels, just behind, barking and growling with long strings of saliva dangling from their bared fangs. Your body is aching and sore and straining against the exhaustion, just barely maintaining your sprint through a combination of adrenaline and the terrifying certainty of death should you give in. Somewhere in the darkness and gloom you suddenly catch a glimpse of light. You run towards it, screaming for help as best you can through your bursting, panting lungs. It is a cabin. You finally make it to the door, you throw it open, and just in nick of time as one of the wolves lunges for your throat, you slam the door shut behind you. At last you’ve escaped. You’re safe. Inside the cabin sits a friendly old man smoking a pipe and mulling some wine. As you stand there, shaking and gasping for breath and crying and terrified out of your wits, he smiles and says, “wow, you’re really brave.” Some of us are brave. Some of us are strong. But that’s not always the case, and can’t necessarily be inferred from our transition. We do what we have to do, however we can, no matter how scared we are. But on the other hand, as it was articulated in Black Swan Green by David Mitchell, one of my favorite novels: “Courage is being scared shitless and doing it anyway.” Myth 8. You’re appropriating the female body. Appropriation is about co-opting someone else’s identity. We’re not doing that. We’re expressing our identity. It is not an act of attempting to emulate or express ourselves as The Other, we are attempting to more accurately and honestly express The Self. We don’t transition into being a new or different person. We become more ourselves. We don’t put on a mask, we take one off. We don’t another cliché metaphor, we just cliché metaphor. It is not YOUR body or sex that is being in any way appropriated or affected. We are making decisions about our own bodies, our own sex, specifically just trying to feel at home within them…. Which is our choice to make. Our bodies, our choices, yeah? Myth 9. Why can’t you just accept yourself? Why not just learn to be comfortable with who you are? This one is usually based on analogy to cosmetic surgery and eating disorders. After all, we do teach people to do their best to accept their bodies and not treat themselves with loathing. We rightly teach people that self-acceptance is of great importance to one’s mental and emotional well-being. The appropriate response to body-image issues is therapy, and to reinforce self-acceptance, not to facilitate an obsession with cosmetic surgery or enable an eating disorder. But gender dysphoria is not as simple as a “body-image issue”, and has been proven unresponsive to therapy and psychotropic medication. There are certain reasonable expectations a person can have for their body, and there are certain conflicts between body map or self image and physical configuration of the body that deserve to be addressed through medical means. Consider, for instance, the case of skin grafts for a burn victim, plastic surgery for someone with an extreme socially and psychologically debilitating deformity, or prosthesis for an amputee. In these cases, we don’t simply teach self-acceptance. That is part of the process, sure (as it is with gender transition), but we do provide medical intervention and don’t question or belittle their desire for it. They are only asking for a relatively basic level of bodily integrity. That line is subjective but it is present. If you’re cisgender, ask yourself: were your genitals to be lost or disfigured in an accident, would you want someone to chastise you for wanting a prosthesis or cosmetic surgery? A body consistent with one’s internal conception of sex and gender is a perfectly reasonable thing to want and a very difficult thing to live without. Furthermore, these kinds of procedures, and gender transition, have specific, defined end-points and goals. Eating disorders and cosmetic surgery do not. Someone with a severe psychological body-image disorder will, presumably, never feel pretty or thin enough. They will remain unhappy, and the physical changes won’t solve the underlying issue. In the case of gender transition, and cosmetic procedures for burns and deformities, there is an end-point and the procedures consistently produce a great deal of psychological and emotional benefit with significant improvements in the patient’s well-being. Most medical procedures are not simply about sustaining life. They are about maintaining well-being and improving quality of life. That is what transition provides… a quality of life an individual may reasonably expect. No other procedure or treatment has ever been proven effective or helpful in addressing the extreme detriment to mental health caused by Gender Identity Disorder. Myth 10. You don’t really become female. The process is only cosmetic. You’re still technically a man. I addressed much of this a few weeks ago in this article. It has chickens! To summarize: there is no particularly valid reason to prioritize the genetic definition of sex above all other aspects of physical sex: hormones, secondary sexual characteristics, genital configuration, etc. Chromosomes actually don’t play nearly as much of a role in human sexual differentiation as we often think they do. The Y chromosome is mostly deteriorating junk DNA that’s only real function is to turn the gonads into testes. In an XX cell, one of the X chromosomes is deactivated. As such, there’s no real functional difference between a “female” cell and a “male” cell. The process of sexual differentiation in humans is not genetic in nature, but hormonal. As for the matter of being “cosmetically” female… a trans woman’s secondary sexual characteristics are in no substantial way different from that of a cis woman and are formed through the exact same physical processes. If my breasts are to be deemed “cosmetic”, so too must the breasts of any woman at all. There is no single variable we can point to that suggests someone is “really” female or not. Doing so for any individual trait will necessarily require excluding some cis women from the category. There are some traits that no trans woman possesses, but there will always be cis women who don’t possess those traits either. As such, there is no definitive way that you can suggest trans women are outside of the category “woman” but all cis women are in. At least not without going into tautologies like “only cis women are really women because trans women aren’t really women”. In so far as the term “woman” is to be at all meaningful and consistent, trans women must be included. Myth 11. Drag queens, transsexuals, transgenders, cross-dressers, what’s the difference? First, don’t say “transgenders”. Nouning-the-adjective places the category above the person. Say “transgender women/men/people”. Transgender is an umbrella term that includes all significant deviation from the norms of gender and sex. Drag queens, transsexual people, cross-dressers, transvestic fetishists, people who identity as trans-masculine or trans-feminine, people who are genderqueer, etc. are all included. Transsexual refers specifically to people who permanently transition from one sex to another, usually through one or more medical treatments such as hormone replacement therapy and/or genital reconstruction surgery, usually along with legal and social changes such as change of legal name and documentation, alternate gender presentation (clothing, make-up, etc.), voice training and so on. The adjective “trans”, as in “trans woman”, usually means transsexual but sometimes means transgender. It’s usually clear from context. This article, for instance, has been about transsexual women. Drag queens are men (typically but not always gay) who dress in an exaggeratedly, campily female way for the sake of performance or entertainment. There is typically very little emphasis placed on actually passing as female but instead on having a particularly ostentatious and fun outfit. This is an act of playing with gender roles, not an act based on expression of a deeper internal sense of self. A drag queen adopts a female persona but will (almost always) have a male gender identity. Cross-dressers are men with a male gender identity who, for a variety of possible reasons, choose to occasionally dress in women’s clothing and accessories and present as female. The acts of cross-sex presentation are temporary and do not reflect their “true self”. A transvestic fetishist is a cross-dresser who does so for sexual motivations, due to being aroused or getting an erotic thrill from the cross-sex presentation. They also maintain a male gender identity and the cross-sex presentation is temporary. These distinctions are important. Seriously. Myth 12. Transsexuality is just an invention of the modern medical establishment, a symptom of Western culture. Hormone replacement therapy and genital reconstruction surgery are modern medical treatments developed to address and accommodate a long-standing human issue. Gender variance, although it may vary in its particular iteration, will not always be socially accepted or accommodated, and is sometimes only accommodated in very specific ways, occurs in pretty much all cultures and societies throughout human history. Many cultures were actually fairly accepting and tolerant. Some even imagined transgendered identities to be especially blessed, lucky or powerful… such as a shamanic role for certain North American First Nations “two spirit” identities, the Galli priestesses of Cybele in ancient Greece, the paradoxically respected-and-stigmatized social status of Kathoey in Thailand, the positive social standing of Hjira in India prior to British colonial rule (which brought with it British attitudes towards gender variance), etc. Gender variance has existed as long as human beings have. Transsexuality is simply a relatively new option for addressing it and meeting the needs of people with a sense of strong disharmony between gender identity and physical sex. It didn’t create us, it is just a means of allowing us to live full, happy, meaningful lives and feel comfortable and at home in our bodies. Myth 13. You’re infiltrating women’s spaces and making them unsafe. First of all, we are women. So there’s that. I’m not sure why whatever discomfort may arise from a cis woman’s hang-ups about the thought of a trans woman in the same bathroom or changing room or whatever, and the perceived risk, should take precedence over the extreme discomfort and actual physical risk that a trans woman would be forced to endure in using men’s facilities. An argument I’ve encountered repeatedly is “well what’s to stop some male rapist or child molester or voyeur from putting on some lipstick, claiming to be transgender, and then sexually assaulting your daughters!” (Ominous scary organ chord!). Well… there has never, ever been such an incident. No man has ever disguised himself as transgender for the sake of perpetrating such a crime. And if what you are worried about is sexual assault and voyeurism then those are the issues you should be targeting, enacting policies against, and the people whom you should be demonizing. Don’t demonize and punish innocent trans people over some wild, imagined hypothetical. Would you ban lesbians from women’s facilities on the possibility of their voyeurism? No, probably not, and it’s extremely statistically unlikely for lesbians to commit sexual assault in such a setting. But… it’s just as unlikely for trans women to do so. And remember that stuff about our libidos? Our difficulty achieving erection if we even have a penis? If prevention of sexual assault is something you’re keenly interested in, then please start by focusing on dismantling a misogynistic culture that objectifies and devalues women and places their humanity as secondary to their bodies. There is also a lot of anger and controversy within the feminist community about other types of women’s spaces. A particularly prominent example is the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival, which enforces a trans-exclusionist “Womyn-Born-Womyn” policy (though they allow trans men to attend and perform). Many of the justifications are parallel to those of the Christian right in forbidding us access to women’s bathrooms and changing rooms: we’re really men, it makes the environment unsafe (again, there is absolutely no data whatsoever to support this), what’s to stop men from attending under the pretense of being trans, etc. But there are additionally complex issues. One is the general transphobic attitudes within certain branches of feminism (particularly radical feminism)…. The notion that we’re enforcing the gender binary (which relates to the “why can’t you just accept yourselves” thing and the confusion of gender identity with gender expression), the weird hypocritically gender-essentialist insistence that although gender is “just a social construct” we are nonetheless completely bound to our assigned sex and may not transcend it, many bio-essentialist claims (such as, literally: “rape is encoded on the Y chromosome”… I’ve actually come across that claim), etc. It is also sometimes insisted that because we lacked female childhoods and the concomitant gender-socialization that we can’t possibly understand the female experience. That’s true in a sense… there are many aspects of a female life I did not experience and some I never shall. But this is true of every woman. There is no universal, unwavering female narrative that everyone experiences exactly alike. There are as many stories as there are women. To act like any particular thing being absent means someone isn’t “really” a woman and can’t understand womanhood would necessarily mean excluding a whole lot of cis women, too. All of these notions seem to be acts of bending over backwards and performing intellectual acrobatics to try to disguise their transphobia as being somehow an extension of their feminism when it in fact runs directly contrary to several of the fundamental tenets of feminism… that our lives, choices, identities and what we do with our bodies should not be dictated by external forces or forced upon us to conform with what society tells us those with our particular anatomy are supposed to be. Biology is not destiny. Remember? … In summary, almost all of these misconceptions stem from the assumption that we’re really men, and considering us, our lives, our implications and our choices through a male frame of reference. A woman who is attracted to men is not gay. The existence of a woman as a woman does not reinforce traditional gender roles, nor would the breakdown of those roles cause her to disappear. A woman would not be asked to simply accept a male body. A woman would not be accused of appropriating womanhood, or infiltrating women’s spaces. A woman’s body, and the aspects of it that render it female, are not simply cosmetic. If there is one myth to debunk from which all others would perish, it’s the notion that our gender is not legitimate. We are women. Just think of us as such, and you’ll get it. … ETA: When I said that a cross-dresser’s acts of cross-sex presentation do not reflect their “true self”, I should have been more clear: in the case of a CD (as opposed to a trans woman in denial who simply believes herself to be CD), the female presentation / persona isn’t MORE true than the male identity. Both are aspects of that individual’s sense of self. But the primary difference between a genuine CD and a trans woman is that the male identity is not held to be false while the female identity is held to be genuine. Instead, the male identity is still the primary expression of self that is inevitably returned to.

More complex storylines, more personalized characters, more acceptance of ‘geekiness’ as something to be proud of and a wider variety of games available are just a few of the reasons why gaming is no longer being seen as a boys-only club. Women are finding their place in the gaming world. , a YouTuber and gamer with 60,000 subscribers, is excited about the change. “More and more I feel like it is normal for a woman to play video games too. It's no longer "a guy thing". Growing up I often heard "What, you play video games?! That's so awesome, girls never play video games!", but now when you tell someone you play video games you'd sooner get the question what kind of games you're into, which is really nice.” GirlGamerGaB , a YouTuber and gamer with 60,000 subscribers, is excited about the change. “More and more I feel like it is normal for a woman to play video games too.

Still, things are improving: a recent survey pointed to a decrease in the sexualization of female protagonists in games over the last eight years. More and more women are being given three dimensional roles and complex personalities. Just give them some clothes, too? ...for women in the gaming industry: Most games are created by men, for men. Governments around the world are talking about the lack of women in STEM (science, tech, engineering, maths) – for the gaming world, the problem manifests itself in fewer female coders and developers to create games. Those who do make it into the industry, face lower salaries for doing – you guessed it – exactly the same job – women in gaming in the US, for example, make 86 cents for every dollar made by a man in the industry. Women working in gaming have also been known to face vicious and sexist abuse from gamers – you need only to look at the #GamerGate controversy, where several women working in the industry faced an orchestrated online campaign of misogynistic harassment and threats, to see that the cost of working in gaming for women is higher than just the pay gap.Closing Europe’s Borders Becomes Big Business
Extension Rationale All containers have a node_type typedef and kNodeAlignment constant. Much as containers define types such as value_type and key_type, EASTL defines node_type for all containers. node_type is the storage type that the container uses, as opposed to the user-specified contained type. It is the type that the container allocates. Explicitly defining this type allows users to implement allocators such that the allocated type is known at compile-time. Additionally, kNodeAlignment is a size_t constant which defines the alignment of the node_type. For containers such as hash tables which have multiple allocated types, additional node types are explicitly defined for the class. Similarly, all containers understand and respect object alignment requirements. As discussed elsewhere in this document, game development platforms explicitly or implicitly require the use of non-default alignments. A typical example is VMX vector types, which explicitly require 16 byte alignment because they are an array of 4 floats which are processed in parallel in a single 128 bit register. All containers have a get_allocator and set_allocator function, which return the actual allocator instead of a copy of it. std STL lets you set the allocator for a class only during class construction. Additionally, std STL doesn't let you access its allocator; you can only get a copy of it. This and other weaknesses of std STL allocators are discussed elsewhere in this document in more detail. All containers guarantee that there is no memory allocation upon being newly empty-constructed. Since EASTL containers have a set_allocator function and allow the user to set the container's allocator after the container's construction, this requirement naturally follows. It's also simply more efficient to avoid memory allocation whenever possible. Lastly, there is the game development policy that memory should never be allocated "behind a user's back" or when the user doesn't expect it. All containers have a reset function, which unilaterally resets the container to an initialized (and unallocated) state, avoiding container teardown and reallocation. A common high-performance technique is to create a temporary hash table with a fixed-size memory buffer, do processing with it, and then "nuke" the hash table when done instead of going through the process of clearing and deallocating its nodes. EASTL explicitly supports this programming pattern via the reset function. The supplied allocator generally must cooperate with this, lest memory leaks occur. However, it can work safely only with value types that have a trivial destructor. All containers have explicit validate and validate_iterator functions. EASTL provides an option to do implicit automatic iterator and container validation, but full validation (which can be potentially extensive) has too much of a performance cost to execute implicitly, even in a debug build. So EASTL provides these explicit functions which can be called by the user at the appropriate time and in optimized builds as well as debug builds. bool validate() const; iterator_status_flag validate_iterator(const_iterator i) const; See the EASTL container section for more. Containers should be viewable in a basic debugger to the extent possible. A common complaint by users is that std STL implementations use void pointers for linked list items and makes the container overly difficult to view while debugging. EASTL rectifies this with no overhead. See Appendix item 2. vector has a data() function which acts similar to basic_string::data() data() is not the same thing as &v[0], as the latter will result in an invalid dereference assertion failure when v is empty. This is also in the current C++09 draft. vector<bool> is an array of bool. It is not a bit vector. The user can use eastl::bitvector if the user wants a bit vector, and vector<bool> is deprecated in the current C++09 draft. vector and basic_string have set_capacity(size), which sets the capacity to exactly what the user specifies. People have been recommending the "swap trick" for years, but this is an obfuscated and easy-to-forget workaround in place of what should be built-in functionality. If a workaround is well-known enough that there are hundreds of pages on the Internet devoted to it and it has its own nickname, it probably should be built into the standard library. set_capacity is the same thing as resize_capacity which has been suggested by some. vector::iterator and basic_string::​iterator are pointers. Primarily this allows for easier debugging by the user and easier optimization by the compiler. A random access iterator is not the same thing as a pointer, which refers to contiguous memory. Even in the presence of type_traits optimizations there are things a compiler can do with known-contiguous pointers that it cannot do with random access iterators. See Appendix item 25. The downside to vector and string iterators as pointers is that some types of automated runtime validation can't be done. So far it doesn't seem to have been greatly missed. All containers have a push_back(void) and/or similarly useful functions. Existing std STL implementations implement insertion operations by copying from an element. For example, resize(size() + 1) creates a throw-away temporary object. There is no way in existing std STL implementations to add an element to a container without implicitly or explicitly providing one to copy from (aside from some existing POD optimizations). For expensive-to-construct objects this creates a potentially serious performance problem. A typical suggested workaround to this problem with std STL is to store pointers instead of objects; however, such external memory allocation is undesirable for reasons described elsewhere in this document. list and deque have both push_back(void) and push_front(void). slist has push_front(void). map, multimap, hash_map, and hash_multimap have insert(key). insert(key) is the same thing as the lazy_insert function that has been suggested by some. Other related proposals have been put forward. There are sprintf, append_sprintf, trim, compare_i, make_lower, and make_upper functions for the basic_string class. These are practical useful functions. Game developers prefer to use sprintf instead of stream and strstream functionality where possible because the latter is unacceptably slow in practice. The obscurity and lack of readability of stream operations adds to their unpopularity. The compare_i, make_lower, and make_upper functions are by definition not locale-savvy. They are nevertheless useful practical functions due to the large amount of non-localized string usage in utilities and applications. Not all strings are destined to be viewed by the end-user. deque allows the user to specify the node size as a template parameter. std STL deque guesses the node size for the user; the user cannot control it. This can result in undesirably large or undesirably small memory allocations that the user cannot control. Making the node size available like this does represent a leaking of the deque abstraction. template <typename T, typename Allocator, size_t kNodeSize> class deque { };
m.insert(value); bitset uses uint32_t instead of unsigned long. unsigned long is not a portable type. On game development platforms it can be any of 32, 64 or 128 bits. On platforms where it is 64 or 128 bits, it can be inefficient to work with these types, as it is on the PlayStation 2 platform. Types such as short, int, long, and long long cannot be used in a portable way and thus EASTL and many game programming standards disallow their usage in API interfaces. Sized types such as int16_t, int32_t, etc. are used instead. bitset has neither string nor iostream functionality. string and iostream are unrelated to bitset and embedding knowledge about them into bitset bloats the bitset implementation and dependency graph in a way that yields marginal and limited benefits. bitset has find_first, find_next functions. These are of course more efficient for the user than manually checking every bit in turn. Three additional heap algorithms are provided: remove_heap, change_heap, is_heap. Similarly, priority_queue has change and remove member functions. These are useful practical additions. remove_heap and change_heap provide functionality that can't be efficiently implemented externally. eastl::list, slist, intrusive_list, and intrusive_slist don't cache the list size. Thus the list::size is O(n). However, there is a configuration option to cache it an make it O(1). The C++ standard specifies that list::size is O(1), and some STL implementations cache the list size and implement it as O(1). The SGI STL branch of STL doesn't cache the list size and list::size is thus O(n). EASTL can be configured to work either way, but defaults to O(n). The rationale for this is that it adds extra memory and processing cost to the list container, whereas users of linked lists often don't care about the size of the list. The user can always maintain a list size cache on their own. A future revision of eastl::list will likely make this a template policy option. EASTL algorithms respect user-supplied template argument types and are guaranteed to do so. No existing std STL currently does so. The following code does not work as one might expect or hope with any current std STL implementation: struct ExpensiveToConstructCompare{ };
std::sort<int*, ExpensiveToConstructCompare&>(begin, end, compare); The problem is that std STL implementations ignore the user-specified compare reference type and convert it to a value type and proceed to make (possibly very many) copies of it. This can be prohibitively expensive. The conventional workaround for this problem is to create a proxy compare class that references the real compare object. Why not simply have the algorithms obey the user's request and avoid such workarounds and their resulting overhead? It's not clear if the C++ standard requires that the user's request be respected, but it would be nice if it did. The currently proposed std::ref adapater could help this situation with existing std STL implementations, but it would be nice if they didn't require this. EASTL type traits can be explicitly user-controlled. Some type traits cannot be discerned by compilers, and in some cases you may want to override the compiler's automatic view of a type trait. EASTL provides a supported mechanism for explicitly setting a type_trait: EASTL_DECLARE_*. An example of this is EASTL_DECLARE_TRIVIAL_RELOCATE(x). EASTL's shared_ptr/weak_ptr allow the user to specify an allocator instead of implicitly using global new. As described in the game software issues section, global new usage is often verboten in game software development, at least for console platforms. Thus any library facility which uses global operator new or any memory allocation that cannot be controlled by the user is unacceptable. Allocators are named. All containers have a default name in case one isn't supplied by the user. Naming allocators and allocations is a common and useful practice for software development where all memory must be accounted for. Tracking allocations by file/line doesn't work well with libraries - especially fundamental libraries such as STL - and EASTL builds it into the API, though allocators can ignore it when appropriate. This is a case of a feature that might not be popular if it was in std STL, but since EASTL is developed for use by a game development company it works well. queue, priority_queue, and stack have a get_container function. It is sometimes simply practical to have this. A typical case is one whereby the creator of the queue is different from the user of the queue. It is also useful for diagnostics. EASTL doesn't use char and wchar_t but instead uses char8_t, char16_t, and char32_t. wchar_t isn't portable. See Appendix item 13. EASTL defines eastl_size_t and eastl_ssize_t, and container size_type is typedef'd to eastl_size_t. These default to size_t and signed size_t respectively but can be configured to be uint32_t and int32_t on 64 bit platforms, as a 64 bit size_t wastes space in practice in most cases.
Instead of just <algorithm>, EASTL has <algorithm.h>, <sort.h>, <algoset.h>, and <heap.h>. std STL <algorithm> is a large file that is slow to compile and creates large object files for compilers that use the Borland template model (most compilers) as opposed to the Cfront model. EASTL containers avoid function calls to the extent possible, even if such calls might be inlined by the compiler. This makes it easier for the compiler to optimize and easier for the user to trace. Debug game builds that heavily use std STL with all its function calls can be unacceptably slow. See Appendix item 9 and Appendix item 10. EASTL is argument-dependent-lookup safe and guaranteed to be so. This allows you to safely call STL functions with code from other namespaces. See Appendix item 11. EASTL compiles without warning on the highest warning levels available by the compiler. This might seem like an obvious idea, but the most common commercial STL implementation does not follow it. Nearly all shared libraries and most games within EA are developed with the highest possible warning levels, and many teams set warnings to be errors. As it currently stands, usage of the C++ standard library and STL provided by the aforementioned vendor must be wrapped in warning disabling clauses wherever they are used. This results in more messy code and more fragile builds. Exception handling can be disabled in EASTL by explicitly supported configuration directives. Almost all game development is done with exception handling disabled. The discussion of this policy is outside the scope of this paragraph, but is handled in Appendix item 19. It useful if users can explicitly disable exception handling in the libraries that they use, independently of how the compiler is configured for exception handling. Header files are explicitly in an EASTL header directory and have a .h suffix. Thus we have #include <EASTL/list.h> instead of #include <list>. Putting header files in an explicit directory gives them a "namespace" of sorts. This goes a long way towards avoiding header conflicts between shared libraries and is the standard design within Electronic Arts. Suffix-less header names (e.g. <list>) don't work well in practice as well as suffixed names in user and development environments. This is a practical reality, and users prefer suffixed file names anyway. EASTL is implemented in a highly readable way that allows non-experts to follow it. All existing STL implementations with the possible exception of Metrowerks are hard to read. They have virtually no code documentation and use variable and function names that are cryptic and/or use unusual formatting. This has been a surprisingly negative point in EA team evaluations of STL for their use.
EASTL_DECLARE_* EASTL has a couple additional type traits in addition to the TR1 set. Of note is the has_trivial_relocate trait, which defines whether a class instance can be moved (memcpy'd) to another location in memory safely. This is useful for classes that are expensive to copy construct and assign but are easy to memcpy. The classic example is a reference count. A vector of reference counts is expensive to manipulate because it triggers what we call "ref count storms" or "ref count thrashing" which slows down execution and makes some types of debugging very difficult. However, a reference count is merely an integer and so can memcpy'd to its new location by the vector. Note that a relocatable object is not the same thing as a POD. A POD may or may not be relocatable, and a non-POD may or may not be relocatable. relocation is very much related to move semantics proposed for the C++ language, but is called "relocate" in order to avoid confusion with evolving definition of move semantics. EASTL has a formal mechanism which allows the user to explicitly ascribe a type trait to a class. This can be applied to most of the type traits but is particularly targeted at the type traits which the compiler cannot determine for itself. For example, the EASTL_DECLARE_HAS_TRIVIAL_RELOCATE(T) tells the compiler that type T should have the has_trivial_relocate type trait. uninitialized_copy_ptr
1 file / line The __FILE__ and __LINE__ values of the allocation request are stored. This is lightweight but doesn't work well when the allocation comes from within a shared library, such as STL. Another problem with it is that it doesn't tell you anything about the nature of the allocation, such as who did the allocation or what the allocation is used for. 2 call stack The call stack of the allocation request is stored. This works well but is not as lightweight as file / line tagging. As with file / line tagging, call stack tagging doesn't tell you much about the allocation aside from where it was done. 3 name The allocation is given a name, such as "VehicleInfo". This has the advantage of telling you what the allocation is used for. For categorization and budgeting purposes, the name can be hierarchical, such as with "Automata/VehicleInfo". Allocation names can also be used in many cases to tell you where the allocation occurred as well. Memory tagging combined with detailed heap reports can tell you if similarly used memory is physically proximate. A disadvantage of this scheme is that it requires explicit support in user libraries; it cannot be automatically generated like a call stack can.
Poor performance. atoi, strtol, etc. A problem with functions such as atoi and strtol is that they work with non-portable types such as long and wchar_t. On game platforms, a long may be an inefficient data type (as it is on the Playstation 2). It is preferable to use APIs that work with sized types such as uint32_t and uint64_t, as they guarantee portable behavior and in practice are at least as efficient as types such as int and long. See Appendix item 21. strncpy, strncat These functions are too hard to use safely. We have replaced them with strlcpy and strlcat respectively, though much game software inside and outside EA still use these. Also, the fixed_string or fixed_substring class can be safely used to replace these functions in a friendly way. strftime, set_locale C-provided locale functionality suffers from being neither portable nor overridable. There is no portable way to tell what locale to use, as compilers implement it differently. However, the differences can often be abstracted away with macros. But once you get over this you still have the problem of API functions not always being helpful. The strftime function, for example, doesn't do time/date format localization but instead requires the user to do it. Again the user is required to abstract this away. Another problem is that the user has no way of extending or modifying the behavior of functions like strftime to accomodate some practical requirement. An end result of this is that game software often just rewrites functions like strftime to be simpler, more flexible, and usually more efficient as well. new/delete, malloc/free Custom heaps fragment memory less, use memory more efficiently, and handle aligned memory better that system provided heaps. Custom heaps provide built-in debugging features such as tagging and strong validation, among others. Additionally, gaming platforms often require usage of different kinds of memory for which there is no portable API to manipulate. assert The fundamental problem with assert is that there is no way to override it or intercept it and redirect it to application-provided facilities. The result is that assert usage is verboten because it operates outside the application's control and in practice usually unilaterally causes the application to exit. This is unfortunate because it goes against the purpose of standard library facilities: to provide a portable standard implementation of useful universal functionality. What we would like to see in the C++ standard is a portable way for users to be able to override the assert function and redefine its behavior.

"Muncie Boil Water Advisory This is an important message from Indiana American Water. Our water system recently violated a drinking water standard. Although this is not an emergency, we are issuing a boil water advisory as a precautionary measure through at least 10 p.m., Tuesday, November 15, 2016 while samples are being collected and analyzed. Customers in the affected area are advised to drink and cook with tap water only after boiling it for approximately three minutes. Tap water can be used for washing/bathing. As our customers, you have a right to know what happened, what you should do, and what we are doing to correct this situation. We are required to monitor your drinking water for specific contaminants on a regular basis. The results of regular monitoring are an indicator of whether or not our drinking water meets EPA's health standards. Our November 14, 2016 results showed the combined filter effluent turbidity exceeded 1 NTU. If you have specific health concerns, consult your doctor. Turbidity has no health effects. However, turbidity can interfere with disinfection and provide a medium for microbial growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches. The treatment issue leading to the turbidity violation occurred during routine maintenance after valves opened beyond their normal range, resulting in an increased turbidity level beyond the permitted limit for less than one hour. During this time, the chloramine disinfection residual remained within its normal range and never dropped below 2 parts per million in the water leaving the treatment plant and at a representative site within the distribution system where it is continuously monitored. The problem has already been corrected and Indiana American Water is in the process of collecting and analyzing samples to ensure the safety of your drinking water. Any additional information regarding this boil advisory will be shared with residents through local media outlets, the company's Facebook page and through the company’s CodeRed phone notification service. Please share this information with all other people who drink this water, especially those who may not have received this notice directly (for example, people in apartments, nursing homes, schools, and businesses). Customers can also call the Indiana American Water Customer Service Center at 1-800-492-8373 for the latest updates."
The sociocultural curriculum at Washington University is designed with very specific goals in mind, perhaps none more important than “get your research funded.” So, while I would like to say that the Proposal Writing course that we are privileged to have at WashU was the most influential to my ability to win money, the process started before that. First, I consider the National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant (NSFDDRIG) as a prototype, as it may be the longest and most comprehensive form of a dissertation research grant for sociocultural anthropologists. My proposal for the NSFDDRIG was ten pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman, 11pt font, justified, with one-inch margins on all sides. (Additionally, there was a four-page section of References Cited in the same format. I used the Chicago Manual of Style author-date citation.) That gives me an enormous amount of room to explain my project, and that’s important because proposal writing (for me) amounts to the spectre of my mentors watching as I write while incessantly asking, “Why is that important?” and “How do you know that?” The headers of the NSFDDRIG are up to the author, so I took some winning proposals which were generously donated by more senior graduate students and constructed my own in this order:
This is an important first consideration because it serves as a kind of checklist. One of the first things that I needed to do as a graduate student at WashU was prepare my “Second Year Paper,” a sort of part lit review, part non-thesis made up of three parts: two theoretical (I chose Postcolonial Theory and Masculinity) and one Area Studies (i.e. Senegal for me). This paper needed to be submitted to my committee by early-January of my second year. Just before that, in the fall semester of the second year, we’re taking a Research Methods in Anthropology course. Therefore, by the time we begin our Proposal Writing course in the spring of our second year, we’ve already got our literature review and our methods roughly done – which were a full seven pages of my ten-page proposal. The biggest challenge for me in the Proposal Writing course was not designing the research (much of that had already been cooking for a couple years), but stringing it all together in a cogent, deliberate, and airtight argument. While we spent weeks writing and re-writing and re-writing the Problem Statement and Objectives in a class dedicated to fine-tuning the argument, I was also taking a course in Argumentation through Ethnography which was teaching me – by deep-reading newly published ethnographic monographs – how to piece together arguments and turn data into evidence. That semester completely changed the way I thought about writing and the most significant lessons I learned were simple: Say what you’re going to do and don’t leave loose ends.

The work and systems are as professional as any other FMCG company. But the work culture and what the brand stands for in terms of living with a purpose is totally different.”Four years ago, Srivastava joined Yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. as senior manager marketing and sales from Himalaya . He’s not alone in his enthusiasm. In the past six months, as many as 250 executives have joined Patanjali from established fast-moving consumer goods companies. Patanjali itself has in the meantime been winning market share from its rivals as becomes a strong contender in the FMCG stakes.Executives have joined from Hindustan Unilever and Procter & Gamble, apart from domestic companies Himalaya, Bisleri and Emami . The company is deluged with applications, it says.Apart from the controversial Ramdev’s charisma, many are drawn by the prospects for career growth, the chance of taking a business to new heights and the ethos of the company.“Ours is not a corporate culture--it is a spiritual culture and it is purpose-driven,” said managing director Acharya Balkrishna. Ramdev says people are drawn by Patanjali’s objectives of reinvesting in society and nation building.“There is no company that can be compared to Patanjali,” he said. “Professionals earlier did not have a place where they could take care of their family needs and at the same time work for a purpose, to give back to society and be proud of what they do.” It isn’t looking for top-bracket, Indian Institute of Management-trained professionals who command crores in pay.“Our compensation packages are in line with industry standards,” said managing director Balkrishna. “We do not seek great qualifications. During our interviews, we only make sure of two things--that the applicant does not smoke or consume liquor and should be of Satvik nature.”This has led to questions about its ability to recruit the best talent, especially at the senior level. But that’s exactly what may be a draw for some.Sharad Bharadwaj, who joined Patanjali as western zonal manager in 2015 from P&G, said he was taken by the swadeshi model and the emphasis on treating employees well.“At least 70% of the talent in MNCs is sidelined,” he said. “At Patanjali, they do not give up on an individual. If someone is not up to a task, he is trained to do things that he is capable of. That does not mean there are no targets and we are all very aggressive about that. In that sense, it is like any other FMCG company with accountability.” There is criticism that the system isn’t professional enough. “Patanjali does not have a professional CEO who can attract top talent,” said the CEO of an Indian soaps and detergent maker. “Their systems and processes are still rudimentary and until they improve that, attracting senior-level talent will be a challenge.”Vibhav Dhawan, managing partner at search firm Positive Moves Consulting, said, "While there will always be people Patanjali will be looking to hire, the A-grade, top-notch talent looking for sustainable career growth and pedigree are unlikely to join the company."But people are keen on joining, said Abneesh Roy, vice president at Edelweiss Securities. Patanjali is seeking to professionalise the management and incorporate processes and technology in the work culture. “During our visit and interactions, we found there any many professionals who are managing different units and have past work experience in companies like Dabur, Shahnaz Hussain, SGH Labs and Alkem Laboratories,” he said.Gurvinder Pal Singh, who joined eight months ago from Bisleri, said Patanjali was the ideal FMCG company to his mind. “Bisleri distributors were co-distributors of Patanjali brands and I was hugely impressed with their admiration for the brand and product quality,” he said. “I was also a consumer of the brand--toothpaste and atta--and the product quality was very good. That further motivated me and in the last eight months I have learnt more in Patanjali than in my previous 12 years.”Ramdev is closely involved, participating in discussions with advertising agencies, on marketing plans or research, said a senior manager. “Baba Ramdev is an astute manager with exemplary oratory skills,” said Rahul Nene, managing director of Witthaus Management Consulting, a talent search company. “Nobody has probably understood rural marketing so well and in such a short time… this is probably the magnet for officials to move out of established firms.” Besides, a growing firm offers greater opportunity than mature ones, he said. Pratima Kumari, who joined Patanjali as a marketing manager from DDB Mudra four months ago, echoed this view.“I get an opportunity to grow along with the brand,” she said. “In the mid and junior levels, I see the kind of respect this organisation gives its employees, which is missing in other companies.” Seniors are enjoined to treat colleagues with respect—rude behaviour is frowned upon. The dress code is white—it’s probably the only FMCG company where an executive can wear a kurta pyjama to work.Started as a pharmacy in Haridwar in 1997, Patanjali is now a Rs 2,000 crore company with about 1,500 employees. Reporting to Balkrishna are three vice-presidents: CP Nagpal heads foods and juices and used to be with Dabur; Ravindra Kumar Chaudhary leads the cosmetics business and was previously with Emami; and Rakesh Sharma is chief of sales and marketing, having worked with HUL earlier. Sharma, who used to handle HR as well, elaborated on hiring practices.“We do not follow the conventional FMCG system of hiring IIMs or IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) candidates or those with fancy degrees,” he said. “We are also recruiting youths, around 250 from several non-metros in each market, training them and taking them on our rolls as territory in-charges… Corporates tend to view non-English speaking youth as unqualified, when the fact is it has nothing to do with the actual skills required.Rajesh Sharma joined Patanjali as senior manager of sales and marketing a month ago after 14 years in companies such as Revlon and JL Morrison, having been struck by a Discovery Channel report on the big profits that multinational FMCG companies made in India.“When I heard about Patanjali, I was willing to even take a pay cut to join,” he said. “Patanjali not only matched my compensation expectations but also offered a work culture rich in diversity of talent in the truest sense.”Patanjali prefers people without experience, he said. “All they need is enthusiasm and commitment. I have seen a mix of city and rural employees, some of whom you think are almost illiterate, but their work enthusiasm and commitment are amazing.”A CLSA report last year didn’t stint on praise, bearing the title “Wish You Were Listed.” Patanjali has pitchforked itself into the top league with profit said to be in excess of such companies as Jyothy Laboratories and Emami, it said.“The plans are even more interesting as the company is now looking at ‘traditional’ ways to expand and targets to more than double the top line in coming years,” CLSA said.Rishabh Sinha, a regional manager who joined a year ago from HUL, said the nature of the company appealed to him. “That this was a swadeshi company and the culture based on spirituality appealed to me,” he said. “In all other senses, the level of professionalism in the company and systems and processes are as good as any FMCG company,” he said.Damodar Mall, CEO of Reliance Retail, pointed out that “Elitist FMCG is a homogenous club. Mavericks do not fit well there. The lure of an untreated marketing challenge appeals to such people.”Managers at some rivals are dismissive of those who’ve left to join Ramdev’s company. Patanjali executives put this down to envy.“That is always an elitist view of established players,” VP Rakesh Sharma said. “Earlier, they wrote off the company. Now, they cannot believe the numbers coming in.’’By George Will, Washington Post - November 1, 2012
Speaking of apologies, Syracuse University’s law school should issue one for having graduated Joe Biden. In the 2008 vice presidential debate, he condescendingly lectured Sarah Palin that Article I of the Constitution defines the executive branch. Actually, Article II does. In this year’s debate, he said that overturning Roe v. Wade would “outlaw” abortion. Actually, this would just restore abortion as a subject for states to regulate as they choose. Biden, whose legal education ended well before he was full to the brim, was nominated for his current high office because Democrats believe compassion should temper the severities of meritocracy. It is, however, remarkable, and evidence of voters’ dangerous frivolity regarding the vice presidency, that Biden’s proximity to the presidency has not stirred more unease. To forestall that, Biden should heed Alexis de Tocqueville: “To remain silent is the most useful service that a mediocre speaker can render to the public good.”The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints will be mostly healthy when they face each other, as both teams only have a few inactives due to injury. For the Bucs, Jacquies Smith and George Johnson are the only injury-based inactives. Gerald McCoy and Lavonte David will play today, with McCoy having his hand in a cast.
"One answer lies in ... the dyslogistic school of memoir written by former officials who present themselves as disillusioned innocents." - From a book review by Jacob Heilbrunn in The New York Times, June 22, 2008Warner Bros. has stuck pretty much solely to Batman and Justice League related animated features in recent years, but it seems as if the success of Batman: The Killing Joke and the recently released Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders may have opened the door to some slightly riskier ventures from the studio. That's according to WGTC as they're reporting that moviegoers who paid to see the studio's latest animated release earlier this week were handed a very interesting survey.On that, they were presented with a list of possible upcoming releases and asked how interested they would be in each of them. That's clearly a way of guaging interest in the movies by Warner Bros.Among those mentioned were a Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover, a Wonder Woman '77 movie (presumably with Lynda Carter voicing the titular hero), and Swamp-Thing, a character who will soon get the spotlight in the Justice League Dark animated feature. That's an interesting mixture, and while there's nothing to say any of them will happen, it's entirely possible that any or all of these movies could end up on Warner Bros. Animations 2018 slate. What do you guys think of them?Winnipeg's MTS Centre is getting a whole lot flashier with $12 million in enhancements, including a new high-definition scoreboard 2½ times bigger than the current one.
Much to my surprise, there is actually very good evidence that chlorine dioxide (the chemical that is produced by MMS) is very effective at killing all of these organisms in water. This is a very important point. Just because something kills “germs” in a glass of water or even when it is poured on a cut, that does not inherently mean that it will kill the targeted germs inside you. There are several reasons for this, but the most important one is that the chemical will react with lots of other things before it gets to the target organism. One of the primary mechanisms through which chlorine dioxide kills cells is by reacting with amine groups through oxidation/reduction reactions (type “chlorine dioxide amine” into Google Scholar for a host of articles about how it behaves). Amines are a type of chemical that contains a nitrogen with a lone pair of atoms, and they are ubiquitous in living organisms. They are, for example, part of some of the amino acids which are used to make proteins. So, we have amines, good bacteria have amines, bad bacteria have amines, etc. This is important because MMS is going to react with the first amines it encounters. Remember, this is just a chlorine atom bound to two oxygen atoms. It doesn’t have any way to detect good cells and bad cells. It’s just doing simple chemical reactions. So, let’s say that you take a few drops of MMS to treat chicken pox, most of it is going to react with the amines in the bacteria that populate your mouth and throat long before it gets circulated to the viruses that you want it to react with. True believers of course claim otherwise. According to one website:
Next, we have my personal favorite: “snake bites.” I have to assume that this means venomous snake bites (you don’t typically need medicine for a normal snake bite), but this raises the obvious question of what type of snake bit it treats. You see, there are two broad categories of snake venom: neurotoxins (which affect the nervous system) and hemotoxins (which affect the cardiovascular and muscular systems). There are, however, numerous sub-categories, and there is a tremendous amount of variation. In other words, different species have very different venoms that act very differently. Some block nerve signals, some coagulate the blood, some destroy cell membranes, etc. The chemistry of snake venom is extremely diverse and it simply isn’t plausible that one single chemical would be able to counteract all of the different types of snake venom. As someone who does research on venomous snakes, I am begging you, if you are bitten by a venomous snake, get to a hospital ASAP and do not take MMS for the bite. (On a side note, snake bite kits are also totally worthless and typically do more harm than good. Getting to the hospital as quickly as possible really is your only option [unless you live in Australia, in which case snake bandages are a good stop-gap measure to give you more time to get to a hospital])
To review, this chemical is supposedly able to cure an extremely broad array of aliments, each of which requires a different mechanism. A mechanism that kills bacteria won’t cure cancer, won’t treat snake venom, won’t suppress the immune system, won’t cause hair to grow, won’t cure Down syndrome, etc. It just isn’t plausible for one chemical to do all of these things. Now, you may be thinking, “fine, maybe the claims are exaggerated, but just because it doesn’t cure all of these doesn’t mean that it can’t cure some of them.” That is true, but there are still several problems. First, without rigorous testing, you have no way of knowing which (if any) ailment it actually treats, and you have no reason to trust the people selling this stuff. I think that I have clearly demonstrated that at least some of the claims about MMS are scientifically incorrect. This means that the people making these claims are either dishonest or ignorant. Either way, you shouldn’t be getting medical advice from them. Second, without rigorous testing, you don’t know if it is safe. There are, for example, many things that will kill bacteria (such as iodine, gasoline, Clorox, rubbing alcohol, etc.), but that doesn’t mean that drinking them is a good idea.
This claim is especially absurd for MMS because we know that MMS has side effects. Remember that that we are dealing with an industrial strength bleach. To be fair, it is not as caustic as regular bleach, and it attacks bacteria more readily than it attacks human cells, but, it will still kill human tissue in a high enough dose. Most people only take one or two drops of this stuff, which probably isn’t enough to do much harm, but some people take large quantities of it and use it daily, which is potentially dangerous. Despite all of the claims that MMS doesn’t affect your body’s good cells, it is a scientific fact that chlorine dioxide can be lethal. Fortunately, the LD50 (the does that will kill 50% of the mice that are given that dose) is estimated to be greater than 10,000 mg/kg, which is a very high LD50. So you probably aren’t going to kill yourself with this stuff, but at the same time, there have been plenty of lab trials where animals died from chlorine dioxide exposure. The non-lethal effects vary. Some studies haven’t found much in the way of harmful side effects, but other studies have found good evidence the chlorine dioxide causes problems such as ulcers, lesions, altered blood chemistry, nausea, and diarrhea (you can find a good review of the toxicity of chlorine dioxide here).
Things are similarly bizarre when we look at the procedure for “treating” cancer. According to spiritportal.org you should start off with 1/2 drop and see if that makes you nauseated. If it doesn’t, you should keep slowly increasing the dose until you find an amount that does make you nauseated. You want to reach the dose that makes you nauseated because being nauseated supposedly means that it is working. You see, after the MMS kills your cancer cells, they become “a poison to your body,” and it is those poisonous dead cells (not the bleach) that are making you sick. I honestly laughed the first time that I read this. For one thing, Occam’s razor tells us that we should default to the explanation that makes the fewest assumptions, and that explanation is clearly that you are throwing up because you drank bleach. Further, why on earth would a dead cancer cell be poisonous? The chemical composition of cancer cells isn’t substantially different from other cells, and, as previously stated, your cells die constantly. So why would a dead cancer cell be poisonous when a normal dead cell is not? Once again, you have phagocytes that do a very good job of getting rid of dead cells.

Jim McCullough, of Manchester, hit Jess after she banged a neighbour's window at midnight, and she called the police. He has now quit the football coaching and community work he has done for over 15 years, as the caution could stop him working with vulnerable children. Mr McCullough said he had never slapped Jess before. She has apologised. The father-of-four said he felt striking Jess was the only way to get her to understand what she had done. The single parent, from Wythenshawe, said: "I wish I had asked for my day in court rather than accepted a police caution. "That way I could have explained that I was trying to do what was right for my daughter. I did deserve the slapping because of the things I'd been doing
Jess McCullough "Jess isn't bad, but some of the 13-year-olds who live here do use drugs and drink and I don't want that path for her." Mr McCullough said he had had no trouble with his other three children Christopher, 22, Nicola, 21, and Joanna, 19. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: "When an offence is admitted the offender is always liable to receive a caution. "Had the offence not been admitted, officers would have pursued the matter with the CPS. 'Wrong message' "An allegation of domestic violence was made and GMP officers always take these allegations very seriously." Mr McCullough previously had a clean criminal record and recently qualified as a security guard, but said his work prospects had been ruined. Jess, a year nine pupil at Parklands High School in Wythenshawe, said she was sorry for what had happened. She said: "I did deserve the slapping because of the things I'd been doing. "I was expecting my dad to come home from the police station and for everything to be the same as before." National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) policy manager Lucy Thorpe said: "All parents can sometimes be pushed to the limit by teenagers who are looking to see how far they can go but smacking won't solve the problem. "It simply tells your child that violence is acceptable and gives the message that it's all right for them to hit other people." Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

by Tom Lester Old man winter has finally awakened and cooler temperatures are here and holding steady. For quite some time, we fall bass fishermen have been anxiously awaiting a cool down that would in turn our lake water temperatures lower. Although, today is the first official day of winter, the water is cooling off nicely. It's time to go fishing. Personally, I love fall pattern bass fishing. It is the time of year bass gorge themselves with food getting ready for winter. When they are filling themselves up, I like to be on the water catching 'em. Generally speaking, if you can find them, they are pretty easy to catch, and catch and catch. As the water cools down on our lakes, the shad (one of Mr. Bass' primary dishes) move into the creeks and guess who is following right behind them? That's right, ole man bass. Now that we've got 'um cornered and hemmed up in the creeks, its time put your boat in the water and get ready for some fun. I generally start out on the points of main creeks. It is a good place to find bass that are moving into the creek or coming out. They will literally "stack up" on the points as they move around to feed on the shad. My bait of choice on the points is a Norman's crankbait. My overall favorite is the Deep Little N (DLN) in any of the numerous shad colored patterns they have on the market. The Deep Little N crankbait is a medium diving bait that works really well when the fish are suspended off of the points. It is also about the same size as the shad this time of year. It has good action and sound with the built in rattles. I use 10-12# CXX P Line year round, when cranking. My friend, Eric Talley of Corsicana, TX, turned me on to using the smaller lines. I'm glad he did because it has greatly improved my numbers since I switched. The smaller line allows the bait to dive deeper and have a better action than the larger lines do. If you are like I used to be, using 15-20# line while fishing a crankbait, try sizing down your line. I bet you catch more bass, like I did. I know what you're thinking; what if I get a $4 or $5 crankbait hung up and all I have is 10 or 12 pound test line on? It's a gonner, right? Not always. You can improve your odds of retrieving that bait in two ways. First, try using P Line. It is a copolymer line that has tremendous tensile strength making it super strong. Strong enough to bring in a big fish and strong enough to help you get most of your baits back, yet small enough to let you bait perform properly in the water. For more information on P Line fishing line, see their web site at www.p-line.com or email me at the address below. Secondly, there is a new lure retriever on the market that is second to none. I like it because it is simple to use, inexpensive and mainly because it works. It's called the Easy Retriever. Basically, it is a 2 ounce lead weight with a special, film-coated, clip on it that clips right onto your line and slides down to your bait. Once it is in contact with your bait, simply use it to bounce your bait off of the snag and reel both the bait and the Easy Retriever in. For more information on the Easy Retriever, you can visit their web site at www.easyretriever.com or you can email me at the address below. Once the fish are in a feeding frenzy along the banks of the creek, it's time to pull out the spinnerbaits and jigs. The spinnerbaits work well, and in the right situation, can catch you a lot of fish. Use white spinnerbaits in clear to slightly stained water and chartreuse in off colored to stained water. I prefer a combination of gold and silver Colorado and willowleaf blades. Again, because of its strength, I use P Line in 15-20# test depending on the amount of cover (trees, logs, rocks, etc.) I'm fishing. If you're looking for the big guys, whip out a jig. Once you find a part of the creek that is holding fish, pull off of the shoreline and find the main creek channel. This is where the hawgs tend to hang out waiting for that unsuspecting meal to swim by. My favorite is a 3/8-1/2 oz. Bulldog jig. I like the lighter baits because they fall slower allowing the fish more time to eat 'em. In clear to stained water, white is my favorite color. It better represents the color of the fish's forage than any other does, even though I will use the traditional black/blue, too. Be certain to use a trailer, either a pork rind or one of the soft plastic ones will work fine. It gives the bait more bulk and slows the fall down even more. 20-25# P Line will work nicely for you with a strong reel and stout rod. Pitch the jig up close to large trees, stumps or lay downs and allow it fall slowly beside the cover. Watch your line closely. Often this time of the year, the big fish are suspended off of the bottom. They can pick up your bait and be swimming off with it, and you'll never know it if you're not watching your line. If it starts moving off to the side, set the hook and hang on. It could be the fish of a lifetime. This is also a great place to use the crankbait. Cast the bait beyond your target and slowly reel it in. When you think the bait is at or near your target area, stop it momentarily to allow the fish that might be sitting there time to strike it, then continue reeling it in. Change the retrieve from time to time to give the fish different looks. It might make a big difference. Fall and early winter can be a great time to catch large numbers of bass. Keep in mind, however, the danger associated with cool and cold weather outdoor sports. Hypothermia is a silent killer. If you or your fishing partner gets wet, find a place to get out of the weather, get dry and get warm. It doesn't have to be below freezing to die of hypothermia. Please be careful. Until next time, enjoy the Texas outdoors. Tom Lester. Author Information. Tom Lester owns and operates Four Seasons Lawnscape, a landscape and lawn maintenance service, in Corsicana, Texas.

The tone of the film is wonderful, the directing spot on, and the story (written by John Carpenter & Debra Hill) is very well crafted. The performances are well done all across the board. We are treated with the likes of Adrienne Barbeau as a radio DJ who is determined to get to the bottom of this strange fog, and keeps the town informed of occurring events via her radio station in which she both owns and is the sole online personality of. Tom Atkins and Jamie Lee Curtis are together for the majority of the story and work quite well together. Let’s all not forget that this was done just a few years after Curtis worked with Carpenter on ‘Halloween’ and was establishing herself as one of that generations ‘Scream Queens’ and it’s no wonder he chose to work with her again. Probably the most noteworthy performance of the film in my opinion is that of Hal Holbrook who portrays the role of Father Malone and does a truly phenomenal job of bringing this character to life. While I am new to this film, I would assume I can’t be the only one who feels what a noteworthy character this is.
Don Mattingly, Los Angeles Dodgers: Another fascinating situation. It would be a stretch to say Mattingly is "in trouble." He and GM Ned Colletti have an excellent relationship. So unless something goes haywire, Mattingly is more likely to get an extension than a layoff notice. On the other hand, the manager told the Los Angeles Times last winter that he asked the team to pick up his 2014 option, just so he could avoid being a topic in pieces like this -- and "they said that wasn't the plan for me or my coaches." So this is a situation to watch carefully: We're talking about a team with a $217 million payroll. A team with an ownership icon (Magic Johnson) who already has said that anything less than a trip to the World Series would make this season a failure. And a team that hasn't played well early. So anything is possible. Mattingly's players clearly like him, and "they know he's on the last year of his deal," said one executive who has been following this saga. "So if they like the guy so much -- if they don't want anything to happen to him -- they can make that a non-issue by playing better. Can't they?"
Charlie Manuel, Philadelphia Phillies: We've saved the most interesting name on this list for last. Manuel is the winningest manager in Phillies history. He has never had a losing season in any of his eight seasons in Philadelphia. He's one of two managers in team history to have won a World Series. And he told Rumblings again this week that "I plan to keep managing -- unless I decide all of a sudden I don't want to do it." So why does his job status feel so uncomfortable? Because there's a vibe around his team that the men upstairs think it might be time for a new voice, even though GM Ruben Amaro Jr. insists it's only the media that is making an issue of this. "Honestly," Amaro told Rumblings, "I don't think about his situation at all." Asked if he was concerned about how his players would respond to having a manager with an uncertain future, Amaro said: "I don't think the players give two craps about it. I don't think it's even a factor, not with our guys I don't know if a contract for the manager should be a motivating factor for any player. They should be motivated by winning. That's it." Meanwhile, Manuel says this only affects him when people like us ask about it. "I'm still the same guy," he said. "If I had a 10-year contract, I'd think the same way and manage the same way." But he clearly wants to keep chugging along, and management clearly hasn't climbed on board. So at some point, this situation has a chance to fire up. For the moment, though, "I find that talking about it is not good," Manuel said. "It's not good for me or anyone else."
It's still unclear whether suspects will be arrested and charged—as Detective Murray tweeted today, “Let's be clear here. No arrests made. Central Detectives have done a ton of work and have a lot more to do. (Not a Law & Order episode)”. But it is clear that social media contributed to speeding up the process of justice.The only scientists who kept the Business-as-Usual sign hanging out during the war were the mathematicians and astronomers. The other men of learning were engaged in war work. Physicists were making better range-finders, chemists were making better poison gases, and theologians were proving that their gods were in the trenches qualifying for meritorious-conduct medals and kisses on both cheeks. But the astronomers and mathematicians were not doing their bits. While the war was in progress, Albert Einstein was completing his theory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and British astronomers were working on plans to test it. It was fraternizing with the enemy. Scientists of this type have always been dangerous internationalists. They did incalculable harm to Church and State at an earlier time by casting suspicion on the Bible truth that the earth was flat and had four corners, and even today a man who meddles with the universe is regarded as unsafe. One of the organizers of the American Legion started an agitation to bar Einstein from the United States as a Red; the Woman Patriot Corporation lodged a complaint against him with the State Department; an American consular official nearly heckled the scientist into abandoning an American trip; Cardinal O’Connell denounced the Einstein theory as false, atheistic, and immoral; a religious writer charged that Einstein had cribbed the theory from the writings of a thirteenth-century saint. Nevertheless, Einstein slipped past the immigration authorities in 1930, and he did it again last October. Today, he is openly carrying on mathematical work at Princeton. The anti-nationalistic taint in astronomy manifested itself when British astronomers, even before the Treaty of Versailles had been signed, confirmed the new theory that had been made in Germany. On May 29, 1919, two expeditions under the Union Jack—one at Sobral in Brazil, and the other at Principe off the coast of West Africa—photographed an eclipse in order to discover whether starlight, as Einstein’s calculations had indicated, was twisted when it passed a massive body like the sun. They reported that Einstein was right. Since then, his theory has been retouched in detail, but its essentials have been repeatedly verified. No important scientist is to be found among the skeptics, although there is every incentive to debunk Einstein, if it can be done. Immortality awaits the man who can overthrow Einstein. The popular uproar over the theory surprised no one more than the author of the theory. He had been almost a recluse. His contacts had been with quiet, scholarly men of his own type, and his sudden glory appalled him. Interviewers, photographers, lion-hunters, cause-promoters, testimonial-seekers, and reflected-glory chasers of every kind came swarming into his life. A man of soft, plastic nature, Einstein was helpless in their hands. He was forced into the rôle of publicist, propagandist, and oracle. After fourteen years of experience with international nuisances and go-getters, Einstein has developed some resistance, but he has not yet learned how to say “No” successfully, and he is still the prey of determined busybodies. The Einstein of 1933 has become fairly reconciled to the occupation of popular idol. He has developed into a mixer, a wit, an authority on things in general, and the probable successor of George Bernard Shaw as the world’s miscellaneous consulting expert, but his countenance still reflects the bewilderment of his early years as a demigod in spite of himself. Permanent astonishment shines from his great eyes under their apprehensive brows.
When he first became famous, Einstein was a strange compound of cosmic wisdom and worldly inexperience. Presented by Lord Haldane to the Royal Society in England as a man of unparalleled intellectual boldness, Einstein found himself intimidated by the livery of the Haldane retainers. “He is too formidable,” said the Professor later at the Haldane place, when Mrs. Einstein wanted to summon the butler to fix a window. When he visited the Queen of the Belgians, Einstein failed to notice the welcoming party at the railway station and surprised the royal household by arriving on foot, baggage in hand. The Professor and his wife were both bewildered by the barbaric hospitality which overwhelmed them on their earlier visits to this country. They agreed that they must blindly accept whatever occurred to them in this bizarre republic; at a dinner in Cleveland, Mrs. Einstein, shrugging her shoulders at what appeared to be an elegant American eccentricity, ate a bouquet of orchids which she found on what seemed to be a salad plate. Einstein knew things that everybody else was ignorant of, and was ignorant of things that everybody else knew. The name of the richest man in the world meant nothing to him. He used a $1,500 check from the Rockefeller Foundation as a bookmark, lost the book, and could not remember who had sent the check. It took Mrs. Einstein some weeks to clear up the affair and to obtain a duplicate check, which was needed to pay the salary of an assistant. “My God, do you even have to sleep in those things?” Einstein is a mental Hercules, according to those who know his work. He has performed prodigious labors. By all the theories of physiognomy, he should be a granite-visaged Norse god of the Hindenburg type, instead of looking like a poet or musician. On theoretical grounds, he should have an iron will, instead of being pliant, docile, compromising. The explanation seems to be that Einstein, unlike most men of achievement, has never had to coerce or harden himself. His work was an exalted revel and his whole scientific life was a perpetual carnival, to judge from a speech of his at a dinner in Berlin in honor of the physicist, Max Planck. A preceding speaker had talked of the “agonizing toil” and “superhuman will” required of a great scientist. Einstein demurred. “This daily striving,” he said, “is dictated by no principle or program, but arises from immediate personal need. The emotional condition which renders possible such achievements is like that of the religious devotee or the lover.” On another occasion, Einstein described the impulse to grapple with his problems as “a demoniac possession,” needing no stimulation from conscious effort of the will. Einstein’s own theory about himself must be correct; nothing else could account for his irresistible energy in his own regions of thought and his lamblike helplessness in ordinary contacts. To catalogue a few of his lost wars of everyday life: For a time he refused to play the violin for charity because of his modest estimate of his own ability, and because he thought it unfair to professionals; under pressure, however, he gave many recitals. He declined a de-luxe cabin on a trip to America because of his scruples against luxury, but accepted when informed that he was hurting the feelings of the steamship line. On his trip to India, he refused to travel in a rickshaw because he thought it degrading to use a human being as a draught animal; he reconsidered, however, on the ground that rickshaw boys must live, and patronized them extensively. Hating fuss and feathers, he has been induced to make triumphal progresses on four continents. He has compared mass newspaper interviews to being bitten by wolves and to being hanged, but nevertheless he is frequently gang-interviewed. This easy yielding to pressure would lead another man to cheapen himself, but Einstein is saved by his aesthetic sense and his unworldliness. He could not do anything sordid. He doesn’t want anything; there is nothing about the man for temptation to work on. When he received the Nobel Prize in 1921, he gave it to charity. When a magazine offered him an amazing sum for an article, he rejected it contemptuously. “What?” he exclaimed. “Do they think I am a prizefighter?” But he finally wrote the article after arguing the magazine into cutting the price in half. It is said that he declined his present post at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton on the ground that the salary was preposterously munificent, and was persuaded to accept only by the promise of an enormous pay cut. He objected to gifts, but his 1930 trip to this country netted him five violins and other valuable booty. His backbone stiffened, however, when an admirer sought to press on him a Guarnerius valued at $33,000; this he firmly refused, saying that he was not enough of a musician to do justice to the instrument. Probably no man has been more plagued than Einstein by offers of money for testimonials for toothpaste, pimple-eradicators, corn plasters, and cigarettes. He brushed all this aside as “corruption” and would have no compromise. Einstein regards money as something to give away; in 1927, he was aiding one hundred and fifty poor families in Berlin.
Einstein’s amiable infirmity of purpose was illustrated on his trip to America on the Belgenland, in 1930. The liner stopped five days in New York Harbor on the way to the Pacific Coast. Before leaving Germany, the scientist had announced that he would give no interviews, pose for no pictures, make no speeches, and pay no visits, but would remain aboard the ship. He was chivied into doing just the opposite of what he had planned. His five days were spent in interviews, broadcasts, luncheons, teas, dinners, and sightseeing expeditions. He even toured Chinatown. He went to the opera, visited Jeritza, and gave his written approval to the late Bill Guard’s brief definition of the Einstein theory: “There is no hitching-post in the universe.” The interviewing on the ship went on so long that the Professor finally uttered a resolute “No more” and went into hiding. A reporter found him. “Go away,” said Einstein, in his slow, reproachful manner, “immediately.” Seeing the disappointment on the reporter’s face, the scientist called after him, “Come back, young man, and I will try to answer your questions.” Pen-and-ink artists were also barred at this time. But when one of them surreptitiously made a sketch, Einstein autographed it and added a rhyme in German to the effect that “This fat, overfed pig seems to be Prof. Einstein.” It is the habit of this good, easy man to reward those who violate his rules and penalize those who respect them; courteous reporters, photographers, and artists are continually scooped by their unmannerly brethren, who by harrying and badgering the scientist put him into an affable, complying humor. While Einstein may have suffered to some extent under press cross-examinations, he has a miscellaneous journalistic inquisitiveness of his own and is an expert in baiting others with who and which. During an illness in 1928, he was attended in Germany by a world-famous New York physician. The physician memorized one hundred and fifty funny stories and told them to his celebrated patient. It was supposed that he did this to keep Einstein cheerful. “Not at all,” said the physician. “I told him funny stories in self-protection. He asked me so many questions that I was constantly embarrassed by my ignorance. When I found that he liked jokes, I memorized them to stop his questions.” “Gosh, Jack, I was born in a room like this.”It's been another turbulent year for developer Evolution Studios, but the Runcorn-based firm has done right by its fans. DriveClub may have suffered some serious server issues at launch, but the studio both rectified those and delivered arguably the best Season Pass on the PlayStation 4 to date. Sadly, it's starting to run out of road.
Whatever the case, a new patch will deploy next week, adding Elite Driver levels, improvements to the title's Photo Mode, and much more. Where would you like to see the game go next? Take a sharp hairpin turn in the comments section below.The last week brought about some cooler temperatures to South Florida and believe me that is quite a relief! This delightfully cool weather inspired me to make one of my favorite Cuban potajes (stew) ... Potaje de Garbanzo. I think of a potaje (poe-tah-hey) as not quite a soup, not quite a stew and not quite a porridge. It's a hearty chickpeas (garbanzo), simmered with Spanish chorizo, ham, smoked pork shank, Cuban calabaza and potatoes. The taste takes me back to the days of sitting in my mom's kitchen, talking and watching her prepare this divine "potaje". It's funny how so many of the memories of my mom, that mean so much to me and that I hold dear, took place in her kitchen. A little choked up and a big sigh inserted here! Anyway, back to the "potaje". To me, the perfect spoonful has a piece of chorizo, calabaza, and chickpea swimming in the smokey, paprika infused tomato-y broth. Add your favorite bread to dunk in the savory broth or white rice and your meal has just graduated to a traditional Cuban meal. This is nothing short of absolutely, positively delicious! I am pretty certain that my favorite Potaje de Garbanzo may become one your favorites too!1 tablespoon olive oil1 large vidalia onion, chopped3-4 garlic cloves, chopped1 large bell pepper chopped4 small dried and cured Spanish chorizo* links, sliced on the diagonal1 tablespoon sweet, smoked Spanish paprika1 tablespoon granulated garlic powder1 laurel bay leaf1 8 oz can tomato sauce4 cups chicken stock1 1/2 dry white wine1 pounds of garbanzo beans1 1/2 pounds of smoked pork shank8 oz ham steak cubed1/2 Cuban calabaza squash (or butternut squash), peeled and diced into large pieces1 - 2 large red potatoes, peeled, diced1/2 teaspoon salt Soak the beans 24 hours ahead of cooking time, change water whenever possible. Place the rinse beans and place in a pot with enough water to go about 2 inches above beans. Bring to a rolling boil and cook for 5 minutes on high. Cover and turn off heat. Leave in water for 1 hour. Remove and rinse beans set aside. Throw out water.Heat a deep, heavy bottomed dutch oven over medium heat. Add olive oil, onions, pepper and garlic. Saute for 5-7 minutes or until vegetables are tender, add sliced chorizo, paprika, bay leaf and garlic powder stir well to incorporate. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, making sure the chorizo has expelled it's oils. Add tomato sauce, lower heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, covered. Add all of the remaining ingredients,, and stir to combine. Cook for 1 hour or until beans are almost tender. Add salt and cook for another 1/2 hour.Serve in deep bowls along with crusty Cuban or French bread and/or, as served traditionally, with white rice. Enoy!substitute Spanish chorizo with Mexican chorizo, the flavor profiles are completely different.I like to to dice my calabaza (squash) in large pieces so that I actually have pieces of it remaining in the stew once it is done cooking. It tends to break down considerably during the cooking process.. After sauteing and simmering vegetables and chorizo in the tomato sauce, transfer all ingredients,, to the slow cooker and cook on high for 4-5 hourson low for 8-9 hours. Half hour before cook time is up add in the salt.I never add salt to beans until they are almost done. It is my experience that salt added to the beginning of the bean's cooking process will keep the beans from softening. See my post Salt Will Keep Your Beans from Softening for more information on bean cookery!Crispy Rice Crispy Rice is unaware they can edit their status GTR.co.uk seasoned Member
I consider myself a fairly competent driver, I can drive reasonably quickly on a circuit, and read the road ahead enough to make good progress on the public highway. But I had an accident, and it was all my own doing.I had a low speed crash into the back of a white van, it was a badly surfaced road, we were stopped, pulled away.... and the person infront of the van stopped for no reason, causing the van to tap the tow bar of the car infront and me in sympathy to do the same to the van.Ok enough of the excuses, I am posting here to make sure noone makes the same mistake I did. I thought long and hard about posting this, but i think it is important that other GTR owners see this so they aren't stung by a careless accident and the GTR Tax!I bumped into tho the white vans tow bar causing this small crack in my bumper...Unfortunately it also set off the Pedestrain Saftey system, where the bonnet pops up....Which is a one use system....You need to replace the bumper, rams, bonnet hinges....and of course the ECUWhen the accident happened i called my dealer and asked them to collect the car and told them i would just pay for it without putting it through my insurance.Then i found out the total cost of the repairs.Eleven Thousand Pounds.I'm pleased to report the car has been repaired perfectly, even if it took 5 weeks!But I fear GTR insurance won't be so cheap next year for any of us. Sorry about that! But don't do what I did. And if you hit a pedestrain, make sure you are reveresing __________________

City are third on goal difference, trailing leaders Sydney FC by 17 points.Dyngus Day Date When Celebrated : Always the Monday after Easter Dyngus Day, also spelled Dingus Day, is a fun Polish Holiday. It is very popular in Poland, as well as in Polish communities across America. After the long Lenten holiday, Dyngus Day is a day of fun. And, perhaps a little romantic fun. It is always celebrated on the Monday after Easter. The Irish traditions and celebration on Saint Patrick's Day is well known. For those of Polish decent, Dyngus Day is a similar day of fun, parades, drinking and festivities. You do not have to be Polish to enjoy Dyngus Day. Rather, consider yourself Polish for the day, and join in on the fun. You'll be glad you did. Dyngus Day Tradition: There are all sort of ways for boys to meet girls. But, this one takes the cake. Guys, on this day you get to wet the ladies down. Sprinkling or drenching with water is your goal. Chase after the ladies with squirt guns, buckets, or other containers of water. The more bold and gallant boys, may choose to use cologne. Hitting (gently, please) the ladies on the legs with switches or pussy willows is also common. Yes ladies, you can strike back. Ladies , you get your revenge on Tuesday, when tradition has it that you throw dishes or crockery back at the boys. It has become increasingly popular for the ladies to get their revenge on Monday, tossing water back at the boys. Note: Dyngus Day is also called Wet Easter Monday. Hmmmmm, I wonder why!? More about Pussy Willows What happened on this Day? This Day in History Famous Birthdays Origin of Dyngus Day: When exploring the roots of Dyngus Day, Historians point to the baptism of Polish Prince Mieszko I in 966 A.D. Baptism with water signifies cleansing, fertility, and purification. Somewhere along the way, the tradition of tossing water on the girls and hitting them with pussy willows evolved.

I always have a problem with sugar syrups . I try to stay away from sweets calling for even one string syrup and the most popular recipe of kaju katli is the one with powdered cashews and one string syrup,obviously not my cup of tea. I so badly wanted to try kaju katli recipe as it one of our favorite sweets and I was desperately searching for kaju katli without sugar syrup recipe. I found this easiest recipe for kaju katli in Mrs Mallika Badrinath’s 100 sweet varieties and there was no need for sugar syrup.You just have to grind sugar and cashew,mix and cook,can it get easier than this . Usually varak (edible silver foil) is placed on kaju katli but i never use it.
You will also need a Small Universal Carboy Bung - drilled or solid.NEW DELHI: Real estate major DLF was on Wednesday directed by the Supreme Court to deposit Rs 630 crore fine slapped on it by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for allegedly resorting to unfair business practices.The apex court said the total ammount will be deposited within three months with its registry pending the outcome of the appeal filed by DLF against May 19 order of Competition Appellate Tribunal's upholding the penalty of Rs 630 crore imposed by the CCI."We direct the appellant (DLF) to deposit the amount of Rs 630 crore in this court," a bench comprising justices Ranjana Prakash Desai and N V Ramana said in its interim order.The bench said so far as the interest on the amount was concerned it has to be determined as per the November 9, 2011 order of the CCI that was fixed at 9 per cent.It also directed DLF to file a fresh undertaking that in the event of dismissal of the appeal it will pay such amount as directed by the court.DLF pleaded that it should be granted at least six months time to deposit the amount. However, the bench said it was inclined to grant three months time only.Further, the bench directed that out of Rs 630 crore, the real estate major has to deposit Rs 50 crore in three weeks and the Registry will be at liberty to invest it in any of the nationalised banks.The apex court adjourned the hearing by admitting DLF's appeal in which Haryana government, Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) are parties along with the residents' association on whose plea the competition watchdog had imposed the penalty on the company.The CCI in 2011 had found DLF violating fair trade norms and imposed a fine of Rs 630 crore on it following a complaint by Belaire Owners' Association in Gurgaon.It was in May 2010 that the buyer's association had complained against DLF.What’s on the horizon for 2016 and beyond?

Sometimes I fall into a rut with Italian sausages and go with the usual sausage with onion and peppers. Not that there's anything wrong with that but I needed a change! And that is what led me to developing this recipe. I braised the sausages in red wine until the wine completely evaporated and started to crisp up the skin. The sausages take on the deep color of the wine and are then simmered in a spicy tomato, olive and caper sauce. Was it good? Nope ... it was mouth-watering! The Hub, had seconds and he's my "this stuff is good" barometer ... if he's having seconds I know it's a home run.Serves 41 pound Italian sausage1 cup red wine2 tablespoons olive oil1 medium onion, chopped6 garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a press1/4 cup of drained non-pareil capers, roughly chopped1/2 cup of drained kalamata olives, pitted and roughly chopped1 tablespoon tomato paste2 pounds of roma tomatoes, diced or 1- 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes, including juice1 teaspoon fresh or 1/2 dried thymeI bay leaf2 pinches of sugar1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste (If you don't like heat just leave it out)1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)1/4 teaspoon black pepper1 pound linguine or pasta of choiceIn a deep skillet add the wine and bring to a boil over medium heat.

In 1847 Tyndall opted to become a mathematics and surveying teacher at (Queenwood College), a boarding school in Hampshire. Recalling this decision later, he wrote: "the desire to grow intellectually did not forsake me; and, when railway work slackened, I accepted in 1847 a post as master in Queenwood College."[3] Another recently arrived young teacher at Queenwood was Edward Frankland, who had previously worked as a chemical laboratory assistant for the British Geological Survey. Frankland and Tyndall became good friends. On the strength of Frankland's prior knowledge, they decided to go to Germany to further their education in science. Among other things, Frankland knew that certain German universities were ahead of any in Britain in experimental chemistry and physics. (British universities were still focused on classics and mathematics and not laboratory science.) The pair moved to Germany in summer 1848 and enrolled at the University of Marburg, attracted by the reputation of Robert Bunsen as a teacher. Tyndall studied under Bunsen for two years.[4] Perhaps more influential for Tyndall at Marburg was Professor Hermann Knoblauch, with whom Tyndall maintained communications by letter for many years afterwards. Tyndall's Marburg dissertation was a mathematical analysis of screw surfaces in 1850 (under Friedrich Ludwig Stegmann). Tyndall stayed in Germany for a further year doing research on magnetism with Knoblauch, including some months' visit at the Berlin laboratory of Knoblauch's main teacher, Heinrich Gustav Magnus. It is clear today that Bunsen and Magnus were among the very best experimental science instructors of the era. Thus, when Tyndall returned to live in England in summer 1851, he probably had as good an education in experimental science as anyone in England.
He was among the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859), after Eunice Foote in 1856. He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but he was the first to prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters. He devised demonstrations that advanced the question of how radiant heat is absorbed and emitted at the molecular level. He appears to be the first person to have demonstrated experimentally that emission of heat in chemical reactions has its physical origination within the newly created molecules (1864). [11] He produced instructive demonstrations involving the incandescent conversion of infrared into visible light at the molecular level, which he called calorescence (1865), in which he used materials that are transparent to infrared and opaque to visible light or vice versa. [12] He usually referred to infrared as "radiant heat", and sometimes as "ultra-red undulations", as the word "infrared" did not start coming into use until the 1880s. His main reports of the 1860s were republished as a 450-page collection in 1872 under the title Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat .

His main reports of the 1860s were republished as a 450-page collection in 1872 under the title . In the investigations on radiant heat in air it had been necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. [13] A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. [14] In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, the result is the ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).
In the lab he came up with the following simple way to obtain "optically pure" air, i.e. air that has no visible signs of particulate matter. He built a square wooden box with a couple of glass windows on it. Before closing the box, he coated the inside walls and floor of the box with glycerin, which is a sticky syrup. He found that after a few days' wait the air inside the box was entirely particulate-free when examined with strong light beams through the glass windows. The various floating-matter particulates had all ended up getting stuck to the walls or settling on the sticky floor.[20] Now, in the optically pure air there were no signs of any "germs", i.e. no signs of floating micro-organisms. Tyndall sterilised some meat-broths by simply boiling them, and then compared what happened when he let these meat-broths sit in the optically pure air, and in ordinary air. The broths sitting in the optically pure air remained "sweet" (as he said) to smell and taste after many months of sitting, while the ones in ordinary air started to become putrid after a few days. This demonstration extended Louis Pasteur's earlier demonstrations that the presence of micro-organisms is a precondition for biomass decomposition. However, the next year (1876) Tyndall failed to consistently reproduce the result. Some of his supposedly heat-sterilized broths rotted in the optically pure air. From this Tyndall was led to find viable bacterial spores (endospores) in supposedly heat-sterilized broths. He discovered the broths had been contaminated with dry bacterial spores from hay in the lab. All bacteria are killed by simple boiling, except that bacteria have a spore form that can survive boiling, he correctly contended, citing research by Ferdinand Cohn. Tyndall found a way to eradicate the bacterial spores that came to be known as "Tyndallization". Tyndallization historically was the earliest known effective way to destroy bacterial spores. At the time, it affirmed the "germ theory" against a number of critics whose experimental results had been defective from the same cause. During the mid-1870s Pasteur and Tyndall were in frequent communication.[21][22]
Tyndall was an experimenter and laboratory apparatus builder, not an abstract model builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, he had an underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: "During nine years of labour on the subject of radiation [in the 1860s], heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter."[28] This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency.[29] He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite different from that of the atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N 2 ) or oxygen (O 2 ).[30] He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that – no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat – any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.[11] That demonstrated a kinship between the molecular mechanisms of absorption and emission. Such a kinship was also in evidence in experiments by Balfour Stewart and others, cited and extended by Tyndall, that showed with respect to broad-spectrum radiant heat that molecules that are weak absorbers are weak emitters and strong absorbers are strong emitters.[10] (For example, rock-salt is an exceptionally poor absorber of heat via radiation, and a good absorber of heat via conduction. When a plate of rock-salt is heated via conduction and let stand on an insulator, it takes an exceptionally long time to cool down; i.e., it's a poor emitter of infrared.) The kinship between absorption and emission was also consistent with some generic or abstract features of resonators.[31] The chemical decomposition of molecules by lightwaves (photochemical effect) convinced Tyndall that the resonator could not be the molecule as a whole unit; it had to be some substructure, because otherwise the photochemical effect would be impossible.[32] But he was without testable ideas as to the form of this substructure, and did not partake in speculation in print. His promotion of the molecular mindset, and his efforts to experimentally expose what molecules are, has been discussed by one historian under the title "John Tyndall, The Rhetorician of Molecularity".[33]
In the Alps, Tyndall studied glaciers, and especially glacier motion. His explanation of glacial flow brought him into dispute with others, particularly James David Forbes. Much of the early scientific work on glacier motion had been done by Forbes, but Forbes at that time didn't know of the phenomenon of regelation which was discovered a little later by Michael Faraday. Regelation played a key role in Tyndall's explanation. Forbes didn't see regelation in the same way at all. Complicating their debate, a disagreement arose publicly over who deserved to get investigator credit for what. Articulate friends of Forbes, as well as Forbes himself, thought that Forbes should get the credit for most of the good science, whereas Tyndall thought the credit should be distributed more widely. Tyndall commented: "The idea of semi-fluid motion belongs entirely to Louis Rendu; the proof of the quicker central flow belongs in part to Rendu, but almost wholly to Louis Agassiz and Forbes; the proof of the retardation of the bed belongs to Forbes alone; while the discovery of the locus of the point of maximum motion belongs, I suppose, to me."[35] When Forbes and Tyndall were in the grave, their disagreement was continued by their respective official biographers. Everyone tried to be reasonable, but agreement wasn't attained. More disappointingly, aspects of glacier motion remained not understood or not proved.
Besides being a scientist, John Tyndall was a science teacher and evangelist for the cause of science. He spent a significant amount of his time disseminating science to the general public. He gave hundreds of public lectures to non-specialist audiences at the Royal Institution in London.[38] When he went on a public lecture tour in the USA in 1872, large crowds of non-scientists paid fees to hear him lecture about the nature of light.[39] A typical statement of Tyndall's reputation at the time is this from a London publication in 1878: "Following the precedent set by Faraday, Professor Tyndall has succeeded not only in original investigation and in teaching science soundly and accurately, but in making it attractive.... When he lectures at the Royal Institution the theatre is crowded."[40] Tyndall said of the occupation of teacher "I do not know a higher, nobler, and more blessed calling."[41] His greatest audience was gained ultimately through his books, most of which were not written for experts or specialists. He published more than a dozen science books.[42] From the mid-1860s on, he was one of the world's most famous living physicists, due firstly to his skill and industry as a tutorialist. Most of his books were translated into German[43] and French[44] with his main tutorials staying in print in those languages for decades.
As an indicator of his teaching attitude, here are his concluding remarks to the reader at the end of a 200-page tutorial book for a "youthful audience", The Forms of Water (1872): "Here, my friend, our labours close. It has been a true pleasure to me to have you at my side so long. In the sweat of our brows we have often reached the heights where our work lay, but you have been steadfast and industrious throughout, using in all possible cases your own muscles instead of relying upon mine. Here and there I have stretched an arm and helped you to a ledge, but the work of climbing has been almost exclusively your own. It is thus that I should like to teach you all things; showing you the way to profitable exertion, but leaving the exertion to you.... Our task seems plain enough, but you and I know how often we have had to wrangle resolutely with the facts to bring out their meaning. The work, however, is now done, and you are master of a fragment of that sure and certain knowledge which is founded on the faithful study of nature.... Here then we part. And should we not meet again, the memory of these days will still unite us. Give me your hand. Good bye."[45]
In Rome the Pope in 1864 decreed that it was an error that "reason is the ultimate standard by which man can and ought to arrive at knowledge" and an error that "divine revelation is imperfect" in the Bible – and anyone maintaining those errors was to be "anathematized" – and in 1888 decreed as follows: "The fundamental doctrine of rationalism is the supremacy of the human reason, which, refusing due submission to the divine and eternal reason, proclaims its own independence.... A doctrine of such character is most hurtful both to individuals and to the State.... It follows that it is quite unlawful to demand, to defend, or to grant, unconditional [or promiscuous] freedom of thought, speech, writing, or religion."[51] Those principles and Tyndall's principles were profound enemies. Luckily for Tyndall he didn't need to get into a contest with them in Britain, nor in most other parts of the world. Even in Italy, Huxley and Darwin were awarded honorary medals and most of the Italian governing class was hostile to the papacy.[52] But in Ireland during Tyndall's lifetime the majority of the population grew increasingly doctrinaire and vigorous in its Roman Catholicism and also grew stronger politically. It would have been a waste of time for Tyndall to debate the Irish Catholics, but between 1886 and 1893 Tyndall was active in the debate in England about whether to give the Catholics of Ireland more freedom to go their own way. Like the great majority of Irish-born scientists of the 19th century he opposed the Irish Home Rule Movement. He had ardent views about it, which were published in newspapers and pamphlets.[53] For example, in an opinion piece in The Times on 27 December 1890 he saw priests and Catholicism as "the heart and soul of this movement" and wrote that placing the non-Catholic minority under the dominion of "the priestly horde" would be "an unspeakable crime".[54] He tried unsuccessfully to get the UK's premier scientific society to denounce the Irish Home Rule proposal as contrary to the interests of science.[55]
In 1787, Mary Wollstonecraft was a relatively unknown writer who was running a school when she published Thoughts on the Education of Daughters. This was a ‘conduct book’, one of the few genres deemed acceptable for women writers. A year later Wollstonecraft wrote Mary, A Fiction, a semi-autobiographical novel in which she created an independent female protagonist whose ‘grandeur is derived from the operations of [her] own faculties, not subjugated to opinion’. It was also in 1788 that Wollstonecraft began to write for the Analytical Review. It was in this radical newspaper, that she first declared her admiration for the controversial republican thinker, Catherine Macaulay. This happened when Wollstonecraft was reviewing the older woman’s Letters on Education, where there was a clear overlap between Macaulay’s ideas and those Wollstonecraft had published in Letters on Education, especially around the importance of parental nurture and the coeducation of girls and boys. Wollstonecraft also empathised with Macaulay’s attack on the way girls were expected to ‘counterfeit . . . weakness in order to attract the notice of the male’. And while Wollstonecraft had formerly imagined herself the ‘first of a new genus’, in 1790 she was pleased to identify Macaulay as a female role model. Her enthusiastic sense of affinity with the ageing radical is evinced in the unsolicited and bold letter that Wollstonecraft wrote to Macaulay.
Whereas the final sentence of this letter captures the spirit of the two writers’ shared interest in promoting a new model of assertive womanhood, it is the first (now expurgated) sentence that indicates Wollstonecraft’s main excuse for writing to Macaulay without prior introduction. With this letter, we can deduce that Wollstonecraft had sent a copy of her recent publication the Vindication of the Rights of Men. This was her impassioned reply to Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) which had appeared a few months before — Observations on the Reflections of the Rt. Hon. Edmund Burke, on the Revolution in France (1790). Her letter to Macaulay thus attempted to reach out to a kindred political and intellectual woman whose own published attack on Burke’s Reflections had also just appeared. Both pamphlets reflect the feeling among radicals who had welcomed the French Revolution, in its first years. Wollstonecraft later summed up the mood when she stated that a ‘new spirit has gone forth, to organise the body-politic . . . Reason has, at last, shown her captivating face.’The Vindication was Wollstonecraft’s first major success and it moved her into the masculine terrain of political discourse. It argued in favour of a more meritocratic society and scorned the privilege and property of the aristocratic hierarchy which Burke had defended. The first edition of the pamphlet made no mention of Wolstonecraft’s name and many critics assumed it was the work of a man. The Analytical Review knew better and their critic could not resist mocking Burke on this point: ‘How deeply must it wound the feelings of a chivalrous knight . . to perceive that two of the boldest of his adversaries are women!’ For conservatives in Britain desperate to maintain the status quo the deferential relationship expected between men and women took on an increasingly politicized charge at this time at this time. In this context, the image of the empowered woman – as identified particularly in the French mob — became deeply emotive. An example of this can be seen in the satire Don Dismallo running the Literary Gauntlet.This etching was published by William Holland, a radical printseller, just one month after the publication of Burke’s Reflections. It portrays Burke in the character of Don Dismallo, the deluded knight from Don Quixote who champions chivalrous but pointless causes. The inference here is that Burke’s support for the French monarchy was just such a pointless cause. To reinforce this point, Burke is presented in a fool’s costume running the gauntlet past a line of opponents who are each armed with a cat-o’-nine-tails to punish him. On Burke’s left we can see: Helena Maria Williams, the poet, Richard Price, the Dissenting minister and polemicist, Anna Letitia Barbauld, the poet and educationalist. To Burke’s right, are: Richard Brinsley Sheridan, an MP who opposed Burke in the House of Commons, and the figures of Justice, holding out her sword, and Liberty, who turns her back on Burke to support a frail figure with a banner bearing scenes from the storming of the Bastille. To their right, are John Horne Tooke another radical MP and Catharine Macaulay. She, like the other women, wears French tricolours.The people in this print are all linked by their support for the Revolution. The women were distinguished for refuting Burke in print, or so it seemed. Williams who was noted for her sympathetic, eyewitness Letters Written in France had just published a poem in praise of the storming of the Bastille. Catharine Macaulay’s forthcoming attack on Burke’s Reflections had been announced and Barbauld, who had first opposed Burke in March1790, was assumed to be writing another refutation of his Reflections.While only a handful of the responses to Burke were by women, Don Dismallo indicates how the female political voice raised special anxieties. Horace Walpole, who shared Burke’s anti-revolutionary conservatism, dismissed them as cheap hacks who ‘spit their rage at eighteenth pence a head’. He vilified further, describing them as ‘Amazonian allies, headed by Kate Macaulay and the virago Barbaud, whom Mr Burke calls our poissardes’. By referring to Burke’s description of working-class women in the French mob — as fishwives, or the ‘furies of hell’ – Walpole’s comments reflect the conservative fear of female activism.Wollstonecraft’sappeared just a few days before Don Dismallo which explains why she is not figured in the print. According to her biographer, the Vindication received ‘extraordinary notice’, especially once it was identified as the work of a woman.At the same time, her name became associated with other leading revolutionaries who, like Tom Paine, had attacked Burke’s Reflections. She met Paine and many others through Joseph Johnson, the bookseller who was like a father figure to her. He gave weekly dinners which were a meeting place for London’s religious dissenters and political radicals. Among them were Henry Fuseli an extrovert but married artist for whom Wollstonecraft developed a desperate infatuation and eventually proposed a ménage à trois — and William Godwin – a shy and awkward philosopher who was initially irritated by the way she monopolized the conversation but would later become her husband. It was also through Johnson that Wollstonecraft met John Opie, the fashionable artist who became her life-long friend. This was his first portrait of Wollstonecraft painted in the period immediately following the Vindication. It is a sensitive and confident image of a female author, showing her distracted momentarily from her studies.With Opie’s typically dark palette we have the sense that Wollstonecraft is working late into the night. Although Fuseli had criticized her as a ‘philosophical sloven’, Wollstonecraft is shown here with the powdered hair and silk gown of a polite woman. There is no record of Wollstonecraft’s views on this portrait. But her comments on sitting for the portrait below, at about the same time are, however, revealing.She wrote to her supporter William Roscoe, stating that ‘I do not imagine that it will be a very striking likeness; but, if you do not find me in it, I will send you a more faithful sketch – a book that I am now writing, in which I myself . . . shall certainly appear, hand and heart’. This comment contains both prosaic and psychological insight. Apparently Wollstonecraft doubted Williamson’s work but, more importantly, she was did not like giving up control over her own self-representation. The book that she refers to in this letter was her The Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792).It would be an overstatement to call the Rights of Woman an autobiography. The work does however tackle issues of female education, identity and autonomy that had preoccupied and effected Wollstonecraft for most of her adult life. English women she argued had been forced into narrow roles within society, were denied access to education and were thereby trivialized as frivolous creatures whose purpose was only to please men. Moreover, women were complicit in their own cultural subordination through their love of sentimental novels, gossip and fashion. Advocating serious study to lift a woman from sensation to intellect, Wollstonecraft’s rallying cry was aimed at the radical reform of Britain as a whole. “It is time to effect a revolution in female manners – time to restore them their lost dignity – and make them, as part of the human species, labour by reforming themselves to reform the world.Having renounced Christianity in 1790, Wollstonecraft’s proposals were rooted in her belief in ‘perfectibility’ – the doctrine that people can achieve perfection in their lifetime. The work was also based on a levelling principle which took its inspiration from the French Revolution. Both were contentious positions to adopt and yet the Rights of Woman was greeted with approval in 1792. That is because most reviews treated it as ‘an elaborate treatise on female education’. The Analytical Review, for one, managed to overlook the radical elements and conclude that ‘If the bulk of the great truths which this publication contains were reduced to practice the nation would be better, wiser and happier’. The only periodical to attack the Rights of Woman was the Critical Review. This Tory paper correctly identified the revolutionary ambitions and implications of Wollstonecraft’s proposals. It envisaged a world in which Wollstonecraft’s proposals were put into action and decried the social impact if women, once educated to the level of men, refused to continue their allotted duties of child care and nursing the sick. Ironically the French Revolutionary government concurred. Although Wollstonecraft had dedicated the book to the French diplomat Talleyrand, his report on education to the National Assembly in France expressed the view that women were indeed the weaker sex and should follow the ‘will of nature’ in pursuing gentler, domestic occupations.Despite its initial success, the Rights of Woman and its author would become synonymous with libertarian immorality and would soon be shunned. The reasons for this fall from grace were manifold including the reception of Wollstonecraft’s subsequent writings, the details of her private life and the increasingly repressive social and political situation. The personal details were revealed by her widower William Godwin whose Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was rushed into press four months after Wollstonecraft’s gruesome death in childbirth in 1797.Godwin, a leading radical philosopher, was grief-stricken and stayed away from Mary’s funeral writing ‘I have not the least expectation that I can ever know happiness again’. During a deep and prolonged melancholy, his one consolation was reading Wollstonecraft’s manuscripts including her unfinished novel Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman. Within two weeks, he had begun to write her Memoirs which were published with four volumes of her posthumous works. If this was a cathartic exercise for Godwin, his inability to dissemble ruined the Wollstonecraft’s reputation for generations to come.True to his philosophical ideal that perfection could be achieved by reason alone, Godwin made no attempt to hide the scandals of her life. He shocked readers with details of how Wollstonecraft had lived out of wedlock and had a child with another man, had twice attempted suicide, had become pregnant before her marriage to Godwin and, finally, had refused religious rites on her deathbed. In focussing on her personal life and distress, Godwin aimed to present his dead wife as a ‘female Werther’ – the doomed character in Goethe’s influential novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). But in the end, Godwin’s writing is in fact more an exploration of his own feelings and the culture of sensibility than the Wollstonecraft’s political philosophy.Before her death in 1797, Wollstonecraft was the most widely read political woman in Europe. While her death had been recorded by respectful obituaries, Godwin’s Memoirs made a spectacle of her unconventional life. Describing her as having ‘sentiments as pure, as refined, and as delicate, as ever inhabited a human heart’ his principle mistake was to ask for sympathy for her plight and pose her as ‘the fairest source of animation and encouragement to all who would follow’. Godwin was of course deluded by grief but he also misjudged the moral climate in presenting Wollstonecraft as a role model. Those periodicals that had applauded the Rights of Woman were almost unanimous in wishing Godwin had never written such a ‘tribute’. Her posthumous reputation was also poorly served by his publication of her unfinished novel Maria, or the Wrongs of Woman which excuses adultery, argues for women to have control over their own property and is frank about female sexual appetites.In the end, there was no literary model which Godwin could use to represent Wollstonecraft as a subjective, intellectually assertive woman with desires in a way that did not render her contemptible. Moreover, his catalogue of her sexual exploits and political beliefs provided a rod with which to beat all radical women writers. The grand inquisitor was Reverend Richard Polwhele whose long verse-diatribe The Unsex’d Females, of 1798, was one of the most concerted critiques of late eighteenth-century feminist writers. Using the inflammatory category ‘unsex’d’, Polwhele named and attacked a band of women who, he declared, had abandoned ‘natural’ modesty, supported the introduction of democratic politics and who even went as far as to demand equality with men. Unsurprisingly, he considered Wollstonecraft the archetypal ‘unsex’d female’:
On 25 June 1998, at approximately 12:30 pm local time, Matoub's car was stopped at a roadblock while he was driving along a mountainous road in eastern Algeria. The car was fired upon by masked gunmen, killing Matoub and wounding his wife, Nadia Matoub, and two sisters-in-law. Within hours, news of Matoub's murder had spread throughout Kabylie and thousands of angry mourners gathered around the hospital where his body was taken. The crowd shouted "Pouvoir, Assassin" ("Government, Assassins"). A week of violent riots followed his death. Young demonstrators clashed with riot police and attacked government property. On 28 June 1998 tens of thousands people attended his funeral in front of his house in his native village. He was buried between a fig tree and a cherry tree, opposite the house he was born in. Matoub's family played a scathing parody of the Algerian national anthem, which came from Matoub's final album Lettre ouverte aux... ("Open letter to..."), released after his death (Gold-Disc). Matoub's assassination occurred a week before a law excluding languages other than Arabic from public life was due to come into effect. Matoub had been an outspoken critic of this law. On 30 June 1998 the GIA claimed responsibility for the assassination of Lounes Matoub.
We recently wrote about how patent troll Lumen View's lawyer Damian Wasserbauer had gone off the deep end, claiming that an entrepreneur who was fighting back against the trolling was guilty of a hate crime . Kevin O'Connor, the CEO of FindTheBest (FTB) didn't want to give in to a patent troll shakedown, turning down a $50,000 settlement offer and pledging to spend $1 million fighting Lumen View just on principle. That's resulted in a countersuit, arguing that Lumen View is engaged in extortion and racketeering. Wasserbauer (who, frankly, appears to be a bit out of his league here) doesn't seem to be handling the publicity very well. He's asking the court for an astoundingly broad gag order against O'Connor, including saying he needs to try toprior disclosures.Yeah, good luck with that...Of course, as Joe Mullin notes over at Ars Technica, the entire basis of Wasserbauer's argument appears to be a significant misreading of the law:And we won't even get into the laughable claims by Wasserbauer that there's no First Amendment worries in such a gag order, because that's clearly false. It seems clear that Wasserbauer isn't happy with the media attention -- most trolls aren't -- especially since it's been fairly effective in highlighting the way Lumen View's trolling works. Trolls often get away with what they do because it's too much effort to even figure out how to fight back. If someone else is doing it publicly, it lowers the barrier tremendously.
Although allergy-associated T H 2 responses and antihelminthic T H 2 responses are very similar, they also differ as follows: (1) larger amounts of polyclonal, non-parasite-specific IgE antibodies are produced that do not cause allergic reactions and (2) during helminth infection an induction of strong inflammatory regulatory immune responses occurs [25, 26]. In worm infections the Fcε receptors on mast cells can be saturated with non-worm-specific IgE; thereby, a binding of worm-specific IgE is averted. This occupation of receptor-binding sites suppresses the immediate hypersensitivity responses and the degranulation of mast cells (IgE blocking hypothesis) [18]. The IgE blocking hypothesis is still a matter of discussion. Larson and colleagues have shown that in mice the suppression of basophil responsiveness by chronic helminth infections was found to be dependent on host IL-10 [27]. IL-10 downregulates key-IgE signaling molecules [27] causing the level of serum IgE to decrease. This in turn influences the production of IgE receptors on basophils and mast cells [28–30]. Additionally, Mitre and coworkers demonstrated that the blocking of FcER1 on mast cells and basophils by parasite-induced polyclonal IgE does not mediate the protection against atopy, since the ratio of polyclonal IgE to allergen-specific IgE is too low to saturate the receptors and to suppress degranulation of mast cells and basophils [28].
Helminth parasites have developed a lot of strategies to evade or modulate the host immune responses with advantages on both sides [32]. Thus, there is a shift in the T H 2 response towards immunosuppression, immunological tolerance, or modified T H 2 response [16]. In case of immunosuppression an upregulation of regulatory T cells takes place which suppresses protective T H 2 as well as inflammatory T H 1 responses. During immunological tolerance development, effector T H 2 cells enter a state of anergy and fail to develop specific T effector cells which mediate resistance. Finally, in the modified T H 2 response, downstream effects of the normal T H 2 responses are muted and result in an increase of noncomplement fixing IgG4 and IL-10 [16, 33, 34]. In case of asymptomatic parasitic infections, the concentration of the T H 2-dependent isotype IgG4 is increased. A differential stimulation of IgG4 is promoted by IL-10 which is formed at high concentrations during chronic helminth infections [18]. Furthermore, many studies have shown that these helminth-mediated T H 2 responses can also prevent the often harmful inflammatory T H 1 responses by inducing suppressive regulatory T cells which contribute to the formation of IL-10 and TGF- . Thus, helminths are able to regulate the immune responses and ensure homeostasis under various disease conditions such as autoimmune diseases, inflammations, cancer, and microbial infections [13, 15, 35].
Figure 1: Cellular interactions in the immune response against helminths. Helminth-secreted excretory/secretory (ES) products are capable of inhibiting in vitro generated dendritic cells (DCs). They can inhibit the maturation of DCs and induce the expansion of functional T regs [35, H 2 response starts with the recognition of parasitic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by certain pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed on the DCs of the host [ H 2 cells. This response includes IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 secretion and production of IgG4 and IgE by B cells, as well as the activation of effector cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils [ H 1, T H 2, and T H 17 cells. Thus, these cells have strong anti-inflammatory properties, which are manifested by the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β as well as the expression of additional genes [16, RI) on mast cells and basophils; this leads to an activation of these cells and a secretion of inflammatory mediators like histamine, heparin, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2 [38– H : T helper cells; TGF- : transforming growth factor- ; ADCC: antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; EDN: eosinophil derived neurotoxin; DC: dendritic cell; APC: antigen-presenting cell; T reg : regulatory T cell. Cellular interactions in the immune response against helminths. Helminth-secreted excretory/secretory (ES) products are capable of inhibitinggenerated dendritic cells (DCs). They can inhibit the maturation of DCs and induce the expansion of functional T 36 ]. The helminth-induced T2 response starts with the recognition of parasitic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by certain pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed on the DCs of the host [ 13 37 ]. Through contact with the antigen, the DCs become activated, allowing them to act as antigen-presenting cells (APC) after the migration to the adjacent lymph nodes, with the ability of processing and presenting the antigen to T cells to initiate an immune response [ 16 ]. The helminth-induced host immune response is focused on the protection of the host organism and is mediated by T2 cells. This response includes IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 secretion and production of IgG4 and IgE by B cells, as well as the activation of effector cells such as mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils [ 35 ]. Affected by IL-4 and IL-13 occurs the differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) which can inhibit the proliferation of other cells like T1, T2, and T17 cells. Thus, these cells have strong anti-inflammatory properties, which are manifested by the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-as well as the expression of additional genes [ 13 32 ]. Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 lead to an increased contractility of smooth muscle cells and a hypersecretion of mucus for expulsion of intestinal helminths [ 38 ]. Immune complexes of IgE bind to high affinity IgE receptors (FcRI) on mast cells and basophils; this leads to an activation of these cells and a secretion of inflammatory mediators like histamine, heparin, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2 [ 16 40 ]. PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PRRs: pattern recognition receptors; ES: excretory/secretory; IL: interleukin; Ig: immunoglobulin; AAM alternatively activated macrophages; T: T helper cells; TGF-: transforming growth factor-; ADCC: antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; EDN: eosinophil derived neurotoxin; DC: dendritic cell; APC: antigen-presenting cell; T: regulatory T cell.
The most potent anti-inflammatory response observed in humans is caused by chronic helminth infections, such as with Schistosoma spp. or O. volvulus and not by a transient infection. Therefore, it is obvious that only chronic infections with long-living helminths offer great therapeutic and preventive antiallergic effects [25, 26]. But not only live parasites can modulate or suppress the immune response. Glycans of the cuticula as well as helminth eggs or soluble extracts of worms can have the same effect. For example, S. mansoni egg soluble antigen (SEA) has the ability to prevent autoimmune type 1 diabetes by inducing a stronger T H 2 and T reg cell response as well as functional changes in APCs [65, 71–73]. However, the repeated use of helminth antigens might also induce neutralizing antibodies, thereby preventing long-term protection. In order to avoid the possibly critical therpeutic infection with a parasite, one major research aim is to identify and characterize helminth-derived molecules that are capable of modulating the immune system and to implement therapeutic approaches based on such molecules and thus replicate the protective effect already observed in helminth therapy. These immunomodulators could lead to the generation of novel strategies for anti-inflammatory drug development [41, 58, 70, 74, 75].
Given below are a few examples of ES products that exert the antiallergic and anti-inflammatory effects of helminth infections. In a chemically induced colitis mouse model the ES products of the canine hookworm Ancylostoma caninum reduced the inflammatory response and expression of proinflammatory cytokines while inducing the production of IL-4 and IL-10 [32, 75]. Furthermore, the ES products of the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum can protect against chemically induced colitis by downregulating T H 1 and T H 17 cytokines [80]. Similar protection against inflammation was also obtained by using recombinant ES protein rTsP53 from T. spiralis in a colitis model [81]. Hsieh and associates also describe a secretory protein from N. americanus which binds to natural killer cells and stimulates the production of interferon-gamma [82]. The secreted protease inhibitor cystatin from Acanthocheilonema viteae, Av17, modulates macrophage-mediated inflammation in a murine model of colitis and significantly reduces inflammatory infiltrations and epithelial damage. As immunomodulatory strategy, the enhancement of IL-10 production by macrophages is proposed [83]. The immunomodulatory effect of ES products has also been shown for the cestode Taenia crassiceps. T. crassiceps ES products regulate DC activity by binding multiple receptors (e.g., MGL, MR, and TLR2), thereby downregulating TLR-mediated DC maturation and secretion of IL-12 and TNF- . This results in T H 2 polarization [84].
Surrealism was in the air as the CocoRosie faithful came out in force, as hippy-gypsy Renaissance Fair ladies in frilly dresses that looked like they walked out of the freak-folk duo's liner notes filled Venue to capacity.With skeletons and mummies hanging from the ceiling to light the Halloween spirit, and a clothesline stretched across the stage, Los Angeles rapper Regan Farquhar (a.k.a. Busdriver) warmed the crowd up with a solo set. He tweaked beats ranging from hard house to symphonic glitch over which he laid his signature cerebral flows, delivered at a breakneck pace that could rival Busta Rhymes in his prime. While obviously talented, Farquhar seemed almost schizophrenic, alternately dazzling and befuddling as he attempted to engage the distracted crowd with hard-stop teasers and beckons to the crowd for responses.Upping the theatrics, CocoRosie sisters Bianca and Sierra Casady, along with multi-instrumentalist Takuya Nakamura and ace beatboxer TEZ, took the stage wearing stripy muumuus, the first of many costumes they'd move through. Sierra would rock lingerie, an apron, and a sequin geometric tutu, while Bianca put on a Twin Rivers t-shirt from the clothesline, a top hat, overalls, a "Pride" baseball hat, and saggy bottom jogging pants, with both later donning the tribal masks from their "We Are On Fire" video.Their performance went far beyond costumes, though: Nakamura played a Nord keyboard, upright piano, and trumpet, among other things; Sierra spent time between harp, piano, and vocal processors; and Bianca laid down bass lines on a Korg and performed various wind instruments. TEZ was the only musician who didn't change instruments between every song.Everything felt live and fresh. For all the dense soundscapes, they sprinkled in stunning minimal moments like when Bianca sang the majority of "Harmless Monster" from their recent albumwith just a piano accompaniment, or when TEZ nailed an awe-inspiring solo beatboxing exhibition mid-set, including his take on Ginuwine's "Pony."Their theatricality was something else. They played with the clothesline, or at least got caught up in it a couple times, and used a white vanity set to stage Broadway moments, fanning themselves there before an early costume change or reapplying makeup. With her creepy, childlike voice and hip-hop style, Bianca was reminiscent of Beth Gibbons, but Sierra earned MVP of this show; her opera training at the Conservatoire de Paris shined through, hypnotizing with her shimmering soprano, and imbuing hooks like "welcome to the afterlife" and "this is the end of time" with all the drama of a Disney princess.Near the end of their set, during a downtempo new-age take on "God Has A Voice, She Speaks Through Me," Sierra put on a silver dangly headpiece that slipped down and became tangled. Abandoning the third verse, she turned away from the crowd and ripped it off, taking a large chunk of her hair with it. While Bianca momentarily looked at her with concern, Sierra ditched the clump of jewelry and tresses and returned to the mic, powering through to sing the rest of the track like nothing happened.Although the biggest crowd response arguably went to their trip-hop laden "Smokey Taboo" from 2010's, Busdriver came back for an incendiary verse on their upbeat take on "K-Hole" from, which brought their set to a natural crescendo.THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Robert Quinn crept toward the line of scrimmage with just over nine minutes remaining in Sunday's second quarter.

Copyright 2017 KUSACisco today announced that SURFnet has completed a technology test of Cisco's 100G DWDM solution between the National Supercomputing Center, SARA, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, using the Cisco ONS 15454 M6 Multiservice Transport Platform. The Cisco system uses dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) to unite multiple optical carrier signals on a single optical fiber, leading to several benefits including increased fiber capacity. The test involved introducing 100G single carrier optical interfaces into SURFnet's existing optical infrastructure made up of a combination of 10G, 40G and 100G wavelengths. Once connected, the Cisco 100G DWDM solution was quickly operational without any disruption to the existing network. This demonstration shows that SURFnet can utilize its existing infrastructure and help protect its network investment while supporting new 100G data services over the existing fiber infrastructure.When it came to choosing my first “older” Only the Music choice of 2019 it was very clear which route I’d be taking. Fresh in my memory as I type is the recent launch of Venus Unwrapped, the concert series at London’s Kings Place which will spend the next eleven months throwing a light on the achievements of women composers. That opening event saw soprano Mary Bevan and members of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment perform the music of seventeenth century Venetian composer Barbara Strozzi, and by the time the year is out over 100 women composers will have been represented across over sixty events. It should be fascinating, and I suspect many of us will emerge the other end having had previously-held perceptions challenged and changed. So the first track on this month’s playlist is the first movement of French composer Louise Farrenc’s 1847 Symphony No 3 in G minor, a magnificent work that represents a colossal achievement not simply for the fact that it was composed at a time when women were barred from composition classes at the Paris Conservatoire, but also because this was an era during which symphonic music in general was out of fashion on Parisian stages, audiences instead preferring grand opera. Opening with solitary oboe, before quickly and expertly building to a huge full-orchestra climax, this is a brilliantly crafted and thoroughly ear-grabbing work which thoroughly explains why Robert Schumann admired her music so much.
Years in development, Gautier Capuçon’s latest album is an all-Schumann programme of live concert recordings dating between 2009 and 2015, made with some of his longest-standing musical collaborators and champions. Its superlative curtain-raiser is the Cello Concerto (composed so the three movements flowed seamlessly into each other with no breaks, such was Schumann’s dislike of mid-work applause), recorded in 2015 in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe under Bernard Haitinck (first concert together 1997). Capuçon’s playing here is supremely elegant and unfailingly beautiful of tone. However equally it’s taut with drama, and with a wonderful ever-so-slightly-untamed quality which brings to the fore the turbulence and instability which dominated so much of Schumann’s life and psychological state. Haitink and the COE meanwhile are with Capuçon every step of the way, with a multi-coloured reading imbued with understanding of both composer and soloist. The rest of the album then underlines Capuçon’s status as one of the world’s finest chamber musicians, with recordings made with pianist Martha Argerich (first concert 2002) at her Martha Argerich Project Festival in Lugano: the Adagio and Allegro op.70, the Fantasiestücke op.73 and the Fünf Stücke im Volkston op.102; then the Fantasiestück op.88 for which they’re joined by Capuçon’s violinist brother Renaud (first concert 1997). With all of these it feels every bit as much like perfection every step of the way, with chamber bonding which couldn’t be any tighter, closer or more instinctive. Or indeed more exquisite, when it comes to moments such as the brothers’ dovetailing lines of the op.88 central slow movement. Obviously it’s early days, but I have a feeling this will turn out to be one of this year’s stand-out albums. So lucky us that we get it as early as January.
Formed in 2012 at London’s Royal College of Music, the Consone Quartet focusses on exploring Classical and Early Romantic period repertoire on period instruments, and their successes to date include winning the 2016 Royal Over-Seas League Ensemble Prize, and two prizes at the 2015 York Early Music Competition, including a place on the Eeemerging Scheme for young artists at Ambronay. At the centre of this programme now recorded through that same Eeemerging Scheme is the first of Haydn’s late-life op.77 pair of string quartets of 1799, commissioned by the wealthy Viennese patron Prince Maximilian Lobkowitz who at the same time commissioned a set of quartets from the young Beethoven. Bookending this are two Mendelssohn quartets: the String Quartet No 1 of 1829, written by the eighteen year old composer shortly after Beethoven’s death sent shockwaves across the musical world; then the four string quartet movements dating from various periods of Mendelssohn’s life, which after his death in 1847 were grouped together and published (in 1850) as his op.81. It’s Mendelssohn’s String Quartet No 1 you’ll find on this playlist, and the Consone Quartet’s tender and poised reading displays all the qualities you’ll hear across their programme: clean, lucid tone; tonally zinging and tightly superglued ensemble playing; beautifully spun long lines; and a compelling narrative to the phrasing which has you hanging on for their every next musical word.Stephen Hawking says pope told him not to study beginning of universe HONG KONG (AP)  World-renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking said Thursday that the late Pope John Paul II once told scientists they should not study the beginning of the universe because it was the work of God. Hawking, author of the best-seller A Brief History of Time, said John Paul made the comments at a cosmology conference at the Vatican. He did not say when the meeting was held. Hawking quoted the pope as saying, "It's OK to study the universe and where it began. But we should not inquire into the beginning itself because that was the moment of creation and the work of God." The scientist then joked that he was glad John Paul did not realize that he had presented a paper at the conference suggesting how the universe began. "I didn't fancy the thought of being handed over to the Inquisition like Galileo," Hawking said during a sold-out audience at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The church condemned Galileo in the 17th century for supporting Nicholas Copernicus' discovery that the Earth revolved around the sun. Church teaching at the time placed Earth at the center of the universe. But in 1992, Pope John Paul II issued a declaration saying the church's denunciation of Galileo was an error resulting from "tragic mutual incomprehension." Hawking is one of the best-known theoretical physicists of his generation. He has done groundbreaking research on black holes and the origins of the universe, and he proposes that space and time have no beginning and no end. During a question-and-answer session, Hawking was asked where constants like gravity come from and whether gravity can distort light. But there were several humorous moments. The wheelchair-bound Hawking, who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, communicates with an electronic speech synthesizer. Hawking was asked why his computerized voice has an American accent. "The voice I use is a very old hardware speech synthesizer made in 1986," he said. "I keep it because I have not heard a voice I like better and because I have identified with it." He said he once considered using a machine that gave him a French accent, but he did not because his wife would divorce him. But Hawking said he is shopping for a new system because his current hardware is large and fragile, using components that are no longer made. "I have been trying to get a software version, but it seems very difficult," he said. He urged people with physical disabilities not to give up on their ambitions. "You can't afford to be disabled in spirit as well as physically," he said. "People won't have time for you." Hawking ended his lecture saying, "We are getting closer to answering the age-old questions: Why are we here? Where did we come from?" Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Californication's lyrics were derived from Anthony Kiedis' ideas, outlooks, and perceptions of life and its meaning. "Porcelain" resulted from Kiedis's meeting with a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her alcohol addiction while living with her infant daughter.[19] Kiedis also had a love interest in Yohanna Logan, a fashion designer whom Kiedis met while she was working in New York City. Kiedis involvement with Logan influenced his multiple examinations of love throughout Californication, in songs such as "Porcelain" and "This Velvet Glove." [20] Sarcasm was a concept that Kiedis had dealt with in the past, and he ultimately crafted a song around it. He was inspired by former bandmate Dave Navarro, whom he considered to be the "King of Sarcasm".[21] Frusciante approached the guitar line present in "Scar Tissue" as an attempt to use two notes that are played far apart, but produce a "cool rhythm".[22] He had explored this technique on his first solo album, 1994's Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt. Frusciante considers "Scar Tissue" to be a "very simple example of the technique, but I think it's a style that sounds like me". The guitarist made use of slide guitar-playing for the solos in the song.[22] The song "Emit Remmus", which is "summer time" spelled backwards, was inspired by Anthony's brief relationship with Melanie C of the Spice Girls.[23]
The hit "Around the World", which harkens back to the Chili Peppers' funk-influenced sound, was constructed by Frusciante at his home. The rhythm and beat, however, are intricate; this required him to play the song with the rest of the band rather than alone for them to understand it.[22] The bass lick was composed in "maybe 15 minutes," according to Frusciante: "Flea is the best bass player in the world. His sense of timing and the way he thinks is so crazy."[22] The title track of the album was among the most difficult for the band to complete. Frusciante felt compelled to write an appropriate guitar ensemble that would appropriately complement the poignant lyrical content, but encountered difficulty.[24] The song was barely making progress, and would have been scrapped had it not been for Kiedis' urgency to include it on the album. Frusciante completed the final riff two days before recording, after drawing inspiration from The Cure's soundtrack song to "Carnage Visors".[22][24] The title track was intended to represent Californian lifestyles and, more specifically, the "fake" nature which is associated with much of Hollywood. It references Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and uses considerable imagery to capture the evocative nature of California.[24]
In August and September 2014, unreleased demos from 1998 were leaked to the internet. Many of the demos were of songs that made the final album or released as b-sides; however, some were different from the final album version with the most notable differences being a reggae influenced version of the title track with different lyrics and a very different vocal melody, a version "Scar Tissue" with a longer intro, a slower version of "Purple Stain" with added lyrics and different chorus, "Porcelain Alice", the original version of "Porcelain" with different lyrics, an instrumental version of 'Quixoticelixer' (with the working title "New Wave Song"), "How Strong Is Your Love", the original version of "How Strong" and the original demos for "Fat Dance" and "Bunker Hill" (originally titled "These Are Not My Dreams of Bunker Hill"). The leaked demos also included never before heard songs such as "Plate of Brown", "Tellin' a Lie", "Mommason", "Andaman & Nicobar", "Boatman", "Sugar Sugar" and "Trouble in the Pub". In February 2015, a collection of rough mixes of outtakes from the Californication sessions was leaked. This group of songs, which were recorded on April 21, 1999 at The Village Studio, contains a version of "Trouble in the Pub" with vocals along with "Blondie", a song Frusciante mentioned in an interview as an album outtake however the song turns out only to be a rough mix of "Instrumental #2". An unmastered mix of the album also exists that features alternate versions of some songs, such as extended endings ("Easily"), extra verses ("Savior"), alternate choruses ("Around the World") and different guitar mixes ("How Strong").[26]
Californication received favorable reviews in contrast to its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, and it was a greater success worldwide.[39] Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: "[his] vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility."[6] Songs such as "Otherside" and "Porcelain" were called "Pumpkins-esque", while the album as a whole was "epiphanal" and the "RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick."[6] Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. AllMusic's Greg Prato said that the "obvious reason for [the band's] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante", considering him to be the "quintessential RHCP guitarist".[39] The album as a whole was "a bona fide Chili Peppers classic".[39] Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a "more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before".[25] Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that "'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock," Woodlief continued "the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close."[47]

Wright is nonetheless extremely interesting, because he and his surroundings have a virtually pharmaceutical purity if you’re inclined to see them, as we are, as elements of a laboratory experiment. Our regular readers, if there are any, know that we are somewhat unhinged on the subject of 5-inning starting pitchers. In our monologues on the subject, we commence by noting that a fair number of starting pitchers are good for five and only five innings, and turn to pumpkins if they stay around longer than that. We add that, while long-winded starters get scarcer, each year’s harvest of relief pitchers capable of throwing 15 or 20 pitches at 97 MPH every couple of days seems more abundant than the last. We then mention that the success of the Kansas City Royals, who don’t push their starting pitchers and have an unprecedentedly deep and impermeable bullpen, has inspired imitators and will inspire yet more as the tactic proves effective generally. And we opine that managers who want to keep their jobs will have to begin—and will begin–to deploy these redoubtable bullpens preemptively. That is, they won’t wait until the starter gets in trouble in the sixth or seventh inning, but instead will bring in the cavalry at the start of those innings, even if the starter has been pitching effectively and has thrown relatively few pitches. When—not just if—that occurs, starting pitchers who can go only five good innings before detonating will have significantly more value, in both Fantasy Baseball and Reality Baseball.
Despite the use of the perilous phrase, however, nothing in Green’s article suggests the Trump campaign is physically preventing people from participating. Even so, Sanders was none too pleased with the report and aired his grievances on Twitter Thursday morning:Inside Publishing NO WORD UNSPOKEN Midway through the Confessions, St. Augustine recalls how he used to marvel at the way Ambrose, the bishop of Milan, read his manuscripts: "His eyes traveled across the pages and his heart searched out the meaning, but his voice and tongue stayed still." Scholars have sparred for decades over whether Augustine's offhand observation reveals something momentous: namely, that silent reading--that seemingly mundane act you're engaged in right now--was, in the Dark Ages, a genuine novelty. Evidence abounds that ancient and medieval readers relished giving voice to their favorite texts in order to appreciate more fully the cadences of Homer and Lucian. Of course, we equally enjoy reading poetry aloud. The question is: Could the earliest readers literally not shut up? Paul Saenger thinks so--but his argument for the onetime dominance of the spoken word doesn't rest on Augustine. Saenger, a medieval-manuscript expert and a curator of rare books at Chicago's Newberry Library, believes that reading aloud wasn't a mere preference for the ancients, but a practical necessity. His explanation is simple: Ancientandmedievalmanuscriptslookedlikethis anditwaseasiertoreadthemaloud. In his provocative new book, Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading (Stanford), Saenger argues that the practice of transcribing Greek and Latin manuscripts without spaces, or in scriptura continua, made reading silently a mind-bogglingly difficult task. "It wasn't literally impossible to read silently," Saenger says, "but the notation system was so awkward that the vast majority of readers would have needed to sound out the syllables, if only in a muffled voice." Saenger's book asserts that only at the end of the seventh century, when Irish monks introduced regular word separation into medieval manuscripts, did swift, silent reading become feasible. Why is it so hard to read text without spacing? Just imagine how difficult it would be for your computer's spell checker if you wrote a document in scriptura continua. The program would initially have to determine which syllables to slice into words, and then proceed with its main task. The human brain, fortunately, is more dexterous than a word processor, but the burden of breaking strings of letters into words is, nonetheless, a laborious first step. And therein lies Saenger's thesis: "There is a correlation between a propensity to read orally in both past and contemporary cultures and the duration of cognitive activity needed to achieve lexical access in that culture's script." Saenger, who has a Ph.D. in medieval history, backs up his claims with cutting-edge scientific research. (To his delight, he discovered that psychologists had been testing adult abilities to read English versions of scriptura continua for decades, "without being aware of its real-world precursor.") Clinical tests reveal that the brain processes the reading of spaced text--in which words are essentially digested whole--differently from the syllable-by-syllable decoding of continuous script. In fact, different parts of the brain handle these two tasks: Studies of brain-injured Japanese patients demonstrate that, depending on the site of a cerebral lesion, a person may lose the faculty for reading kanji ideographs, but not Japanese phonetic script, which lacks regular word separation--and vice versa. The implication is that, even if early medieval readers of scriptura continua somehow managed to keep their mouths shut, they were performing a mental task fundamentally different from that of contemporary readers. To modern eyes, the benefits of word spacing seem obvious. What took so long, then? Actually, word spaces can be found in ancient Hebrew manuscripts, as well as in a few of the very earliest Greek papyri. But Saenger doubts those word spaces engendered fluid silent reading at the time. After all, he notes, these manuscripts were all written without vowels, making the use of word spaces a virtual necessity for any kind of deciphering. In any case, following the Greeks' swift incorporation of Phoenician vowels in the ninth century b.c., scribes began crushing all the words together and writing in scriptura continua. Indeed, the entire Greek literary canon, from The Iliad onward, was written down this way. Why? Were the scribes trying to save paper? Saenger offers an explanation for this baffling step backward. "The ancient world did not possess the desire, characteristic of the modern age, to make reading easier and swifter," he writes. "Those who read...were not interested in the swift intrusive consultation of books." The canon was small, and prized texts were typically memorized. Who cared, then, if it was hard to slog through a manuscript the first dozen times? And let's not forget the inherent elitism of Greek and Roman readers. "The notion that the greater portion of the population should be autonomous and self-motivated readers was entirely foreign to the elitist literate mentality of the ancient world," Saenger writes. Fortunately, this situation didn't last forever. While an ambiguous text format "enhanced the mystery and power of clerics," Saenger notes, such awkwardness served no purpose in a scholarly universe in which readers began "to grapple with highly technical concepts" of science, law, and theology. Starting in the fifth century, scribes began to speckle manuscripts with spaces. As Saenger writes, "The introduction of word separation reflected a mentality in which reading was primarily a visual process for which the stylistic virtue of mellifluous sound was subordinate to rapid access to meaning." Most classicists have decried sporadic spacing as a sign that medieval monks didn't fully understand what they were transcribing. But Saenger sees it as a "great leap forward. It allowed the brain to find its bearings." He's even coined a new term, "aeration," to describe such manuscripts. Having spent the past fifteen years combing medieval manuscript libraries on both sides of the Atlantic, Saenger identifies the first properly spaced Latin manuscript as the Irish Book of Mulling, an illuminated translation of the Gospels dating from around 690 a.d. Indeed, he notes, the Irish soon adopted the the verb videre, "to see," as a way to describe reading. In a similar spirit, an Irish monk compared the activity of reading to a cat silently stalking a mouse. Why Ireland? For one thing, Irish monasteries were home to a select collection of Syriac-language biblical texts from late antiquity, all of which featured word spacing (but no vowels). Moreover, the Celtic-speaking monks approached Latin as a foreign language, and word separation greatly aided readers struggling with the vocabulary. (The French, in contrast, didn't think of their vernacular language as particularly different from Latin.) In the end, muses Saenger, "people at the frontiers have always been more open to linguistic innovation and combining things in new ways." Over the next couple of centuries, this Irish innovation spread to other countries--first to England, then to the Low Countries and the rest of Europe. By the twelfth century, reports Saenger, murmuring monks had become a relic of the past. (There's no precise date available, alas, for the first appearance of a SILENCE, PLEASE! sign.) As reading became a silent activity, new types of manuscripts that took advantage of this intimacy were produced, from pocket prayer books to erotica. More important, the intellectual orthodoxy enforced by group readings of manuscripts melted away as scholars retired to private rooms for quiet study. Saenger's book is sure to meet some strong resistance. Many simply refuse to believe that the ancients didn't learn to read scriptura continua silently. In a classic 1968 article, "Silent Reading in Antiquity," Bernard Knox wondered sarcastically, "Are we really to imagine that Aristarchus read aloud all the manuscripts of Homer he used for his edition?" Last year, Russian classicist A.K. Gavrilov dug in his heels, insisting in Classical Quarterly that "the phenomenon of reading itself is fundamentally the same in modern and in ancient culture." Why are some scholars so opposed to the idea that scriptura continua would impose limits on the ancients' reading abilities? "It's funny," laughs Saenger. "Mathematicians have no problem seeing the importance of notation. Newton's contribution in the Principia was both intellectual and notational, with all its symbolic innovations. But classicists refuse to accept that reading has anything to do with the page it's printed on." Of course, classicists aren't the types eager to jump on the interdisciplinary bandwagon. "These folks tend to be tremendously conservative by orientation," Saenger muses. "They tend to be frightened by modern things like psychological research. At one conference, after I laid out my ideas, some classicists called me a Freudian." DANIEL ZALEWSKITen Years on, New Estimates of the Economic Cost of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
Five per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800 mi2) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the Lower Mainland and various regions within the Interior of British Columbia, the St. Lawrence Basin and the Canadian Maritimes. Main crops in Canada include flax, oats, wheat, maize, barley, sugar beets and rye in the prairies; flax and maize in Western Ontario; Oats and potatoes in the Maritimes. Fruit and vegetables are grown primarily in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Southwestern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, along the south coast of Georgian Bay and in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Cattle and sheep are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and hogs are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant dairy regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, northeastern Ontario, southwestern Ontario, the Red River valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the British Columbia Interior, on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland.

Mike, in my experience many Christians are extremely aggressive towards those they despise and seek to control and change. They spend millions in America trying to interfere with a woman’s right to choose and a gay person’s civil rights. They are vocal and “in your face” with their hate of gays and other strong religious biases. If they would respect the rights and dignity of those who do not share their belief system, it would be better for everyone. But sadly, they don’t. And when they bring hate speech to this page, I will delete and ban them. Mike, I don’t think the aggression and hostility of Christians towards those they condemn can be compared in any way to gay rights activists. Gay rights activists don’t spend millions trying to persecute and demonize others or oppress them in terms of civil rights. I hope you do some research on this topic. We have a serious problem in this country with aggressive Christians violating our separation of church and state, and campaigning to oppress women and gays, and sometimes children. I think we are in a time in America when we must demand that all people claiming to be Christian take full moral responsibility for their belief system and the harm it has done historically and the harm it continues to do in our country. I see no reason to give Christians a pass on any of this.
In Portugal, none of the five paid any attention to religion. Some had even grown up in practising Catholic households. The conversion to Islam and the radicalisation had taken place there, in Greater London, in a quick process lasting just a few months in the majority of cases. Edgar, the first Portuguese person in the group to emigrate and turn Muslim, went onto influence his brother Celso and his three friends. However, who influenced him? “They went over to the more radical side of Islam because they wanted to, out of faith, due to not agreeing with the foreign policy of the West against Muslims. Nobody twisted their heads around. It was just like that. In Lisbon, the Muslims did not understand these questions. Here they did”, was the attempted explanation of a friend of the group who remains in London. Those responsible at the Forest Gate mosque, a white prefabricated building, modest in scale, which also serves as a religious schools, guaranteed to Expresso that they did not know any “brother” of Portuguese nationality but did accept their might be a few “black sheep” in amongst the flock of hundreds of persons attending the mosque daily.UFC on Fox 15: Machida vs. Rockhold was an event that saw a multitude of lower ranked fighters defeat their higher ranked counterparts.

World leaders have echoed discontent with Trump. During the campaign, the President of Argentina, Mauricio Macri, called Trump a “crackpot candidate.” The Prime Minister of Australia notoriously mocked him in leaked audio, poking at his relationship with Russia, and ideas about “fake news.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been cautious to explicitly insult the States, but emphasized Canada’s belief that “diversity is a strength” in response to Trump’s travel ban. French President Emmanuel Macron decried Trump’s “mistake” in leaving the Paris Climate Accord. And, perhaps most profoundly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted her country can no longer rely on America in allied foreign diplomacy. “The times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out. I’ve experienced that in the last few days,” she said during a campaign event in May. “We Europeans have to take our destiny into our own hands — of course in friendship with the U.S.…but we have to know that we have to fight for our own future.”Most light emitters, from candles to light bulbs to computer screens, look the same from any angle.

In 1932 a greatly shortened version designed for bush warfare was developed by USMC Maj. H.L. Smith and was the subject of an evaluative report by Capt. Merritt A. Edson, ordnance officer at the Quartermaster's Depot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[14] The barrel was shortened nine inches (229 mm) at the muzzle and the gas port and gas cylinder tube were relocated. The modified BAR weighed 13 lb 12 oz (6.24 kg) and was only 34.5 inches (880 mm) long overall.[14] Though it proved superior to the M1918 in accuracy when fired prone in automatic mode and equal in accuracy to the standard M1918 at ranges of 500–600 yards (460–550 m) from a rest, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder, and had a loud report combined with a fierce muzzle blast.[15] Attaching a Cutts compensator materially reduced the muzzle blast, but this was more than offset by the increase in smoke and dust at the muzzle when fired, obscuring the operator's vision.[14] Nor did it improve control of the weapon when fired in bursts of automatic fire.[14] Though the report recommended building six of these short-barreled jungle BARs for further evaluation, no further work was done on the project.[14]
In 1920 Belgian arms manufacturer Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired sales and production rights to the BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—Kulsprutegevär or "machinegun rifle") chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is a variant of the Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt's and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and dust covers for ejection. The m/21 would become one of Sweden's main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled, belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel that mates the externally grooved chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by a locking lever. The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype, which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth-contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel and renamed the Kg m/21-37.[citation needed] The m/37 remained in service until replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in second-line use until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.
With the cessation of WWI hostilities, Colt Arms Co. received the Browning patents to produce the BAR that had been withheld from issue during the war.[32] This allowed Colt to make the BAR available for commercial sale, including to civilian owners. The Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919, initially made up of overruns from the M1918 military production contract, was the first of several commercial Colt BARs that would follow. However, the high price of the weapon and its limited utility for most civilian owners resulted in few sales. Ad Topperwien, a famous trick shooter of the early 1920s, purchased one of the first Colt-produced BARs to perform aerial target shooting exhibitions.[33] Occasional BAR sales were made to civilian owners through distributors such as the Ott-Heiskell Hardware Co.[34] In 1931 the new Colt Monitor was made available to civilians during the Depression at $300 each, including a spare parts kit, sling, cleaning accessories and six magazines, but Colt records indicate no domestic sales to individuals.[35] After passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934, civilian BAR ownership was restricted even further. Importation of machine guns for US civilian transfer was banned in 1968 and US production of machine guns for civilian transfer was banned in 1986. However, some transferable civilian-owned BAR models exist in the US and occasionally come up for sale to qualified buyers. Some companies are manufacturing semi-automatic copies for sale to civilians. Ohio Ordnance Works, Inc., in Chardon, OH, holds an exclusive patent for the 1918A3-SLR (Self-Loading Rifle), which is a contemporary semi-automatic variant of the M1918 and is legal for civilians to own.[36]
The University of Illinois has fired an adjunct professor who taught courses on Catholicism after a student accused the instructor of engaging in hate speech by saying he agrees with the church’s teaching that homosexual sex is immoral. The professor, Ken Howell of Champaign, said his firing violates his academic freedom. He also lost his job at an on-campus Catholic center. Howell, who taught Introduction to Catholicism and Modern Catholic Thought, says he was fired at the end of the spring semester after sending an e-mail explaining some Catholic beliefs to his students preparing for an exam. “Natural Moral Law says that Morality must be a response to REALITY,” he wrote in the e-mail. “In other words, sexual acts are only appropriate for people who are complementary, not the same.” An unidentified student sent an e-mail to religion department head Robert McKim on May 13, calling Howell’s e-mail “hate speech.” The student claimed to be a friend of the offended student. The writer said in the e-mail that his friend wanted to remain anonymous. “Teaching a student about the tenets of a religion is one thing,” the student wrote. “Declaring that homosexual acts violate the natural laws of man is another.” Howell said he was teaching his students about the Catholic understanding of natural moral law. “My responsibility on teaching a class on Catholicism is to teach what the Catholic Church teaches,” Howell said in an interview with The News-Gazette in Champaign. “I have always made it very, very clear to my students they are never required to believe what I’m teaching and they’ll never be judged on that.” Howell also said he makes clear to his students that he’s Catholic and that he believes the church views that he teaches. […] In an e-mail to other school staff, Ann Mester, an associate dean at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said Howell’s e-mail justified his firing. “The e-mails sent by Dr. Howell violate university standards of inclusivity, which would then entitle us to have him discontinue his teaching arrangement with us,” Mester wrote. Cary Nelson, president of the American Association of University Professors, said professors should be able to tell students their own views and even argue in favor of them, provided students can disagree without being penalized. “It’s part of intellectual life to advocate for points of view,” said Nelson, an emeritus English professor at the University of Illinois. “Hopefully when they go out in the world, they can emulate that. They can argue a case, and do it in a well-informed and articulate way, and can make a more productive contribution to our democracy that way.”

While Brazil was represented last year and Russia and China this year, there is no participation from India.The VR World Congress, to be held in Bristol, UK is expected to see participation from the brightest minds of the VR industry and world leaders in VR such as AMD, HTC and Samsung. The event has been sold out for 2 weeks now, with participation from many countries including Sweden, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark amongst others.Amongst the BRIC nations, Brazil was represented last year by VR game designer Ana Ribeiro. This year, Russia will be represented by Interractive Lab who is exhibiting a room-scale Gear VR tracking demonstration. Ximmerse from China is also showcasing its cutting edge VR technology. While all other BRIC nations are showcasing their talent at the Congress, India seems to have given the event a miss. According to the authorities, while there were some hits from India on their website, no inquiries (email/ telephonic) have come in from Indian companies at all."The Bristol & Bath tech cluster has a growing reputation as the European (if not global) capital of VR. The VR World Congress has had a very high level of international participation as a result. World-renowned Brazilian VR designer Ana Ribeiro was a speaker at last year's event, and this year we are pleased to have exhibitors from both Russia and China. We would have loved to have had participation from India as well so all four BRIC were involved. We're hopeful this will happen next year," said Dan Page, Director of the VR World Congress.Entrepreneurs in India in the VR/AR space believe the industry is in the nascent stages in India. “While we are attending events across the globe, it becomes expensive to cover them all. There is a general lack of awareness in the country about the technology,” said Vijay Karunankan, founder, Ingage. Entrepreneurs strongly advocate the need for a body to promote VR and help companies involved in VR to gain prominence in the global scene.“Just days before the event itself we received an enquiry from Mumbai's Gateway VR, saying they would attend if tickets were still available. It was way too late for us to squeeze them in, but I am really looking forward to having them with us next year,” said Page. The two founders of Gateway VR are Shyam Anjaria and Siddharth Mahajan.A report from Statista says that in 2017 the revenue from VR products is predicted to reach $4.6bn. CCS Insight believes that augmented and virtual reality devices will become a $4bn market in three years, in its report Augmented and Virtual Reality Device Forecast, 2015-2019. While the brightest minds of the VR Industry and world leaders in VR come together to discuss the present and future of VR at Bristol, it looks like India is already falling out of the game.Photo: Maya Robinson and Photos by Corbis
While message content certainly influences the disposition to defer (Harris 2012), sensitivity to properties of the testifier sometimes trumps content. Israelis and Palestinians evaluated a peace proposal significantly more or less favorably depending upon whether it was presented as coming from Palestinian negotiators or Israelis (Maoz et al. 2002). Similarly, conservative and liberal attitudes to proposals for welfare policies were much more strongly influenced by whether the proposals were said to be supported by Democrats or Republicans than by the content of the proposals (Cohen 2003). In fact, sensitivity to properties of testifiers is able to trump content even when the content of the testimony is disagreeable to hearers. Corrections of false claims are effective when they come from sources that share the ideology of the hearer (Nyhan and Reifler 2013) and also when they come from sources that can be expected to find the claim they affirm contrary to their own ideological interests (Berinsky 2017). Thus, corrections of false claims about Obamacare, for instance, are effective for both conservatives and liberals when they come from conservatives; the former because they share the ideology of the source, and the latter because they know that the source is likely to find the claim unpalatable. These data are powerful evidence that content-based explanations are insufficient on their own to explain deference.
This sensitivity to testimony source emerges early in childhood (Clément 2010; Sperber et al. 2010). From a very young age, children show a preference for informants who show signs of being benevolent and competent; scrutiny of informers intensifies around the age of four (Mascaro and Sperber 2009). I suggest that this filter plays a significant role in explaining the different patterns of deference exhibited by conservatives and liberals. The disposition to defer to others with whom we share a political or religious outlook is continuous with the disposition to use benevolence as a cue to reliability; we are disposed to see those with whom we share a political outlook and/or a religious affiliation as those who are benevolent toward us and our interests (or, perhaps, the disposition to use benevolence as a cue to reliability is just a special case of a disposition to defer to those with whom we share values). The use of political and religious affiliation as a proxy for benevolence is adaptive, inasmuch as sharing our values is being disposed to promote the things we value and to oppose the things we disvalue. The use of competence as a proxy for reliability protects us against fools; the use of benevolence as a proxy protects us against exploitation (see Hahn et al. 2016 for a model of how update on testimony is normatively rational as a function of perceived reliability and benevolence of sources).
Objectives. To determine the spectrum of personality and psychopathology features of patients with primary SS (pSS) and explore whether they are linked to disease characteristics as well as the presence of autoantibodies (autoAbs) against neuropeptides. Methods. Personality and psychopathological variables were determined in 103 pSS patients and 110 healthy controls (HCs). AutoAbs against hypothalamic and pituitary neuropeptides were measured by ELISA in 25 pSS patients and 25 HCs. Data analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and by comparison with regression models. Results. A higher number of pSS patients reported distinct personality traits (neuroticism, psychoticism and obsessiveness) and psychological distress compared with HCs. After adjustment for personality characteristics and demographics, only hypochondriasis was the main psychopathology feature associated with pSS, suggesting that psychopathological manifestations in the setting of pSS are primarily dependent on premorbid personality characteristics. Although no differences were detected between serum levels of neuropeptide autoAbs in pSS cases and controls, levels of autoAbs against α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) correlated with anxiety scores in both groups examined but with higher intercept in pSS subjects. Significant correlations between anxiety score and autoAbs directed against oxytocin and vasopressin were also detected in the pSS patients. Conclusions. pSS patients exhibit a distinct pattern of personality traits and high levels of psychological distress compared with HCs, which seems to be determined by premorbid personality characteristics. Correlations between anxiety and α-MSH autoAbs suggest their potential involvement in anxiety development in both pSS and HCs.
The individual associations between psychopathology variables, personality characteristics and pSS were evaluated using odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% CIs calculated using univariate logistic regression. If the 95% CIs of OR did not include the value of 1.0 the association was significant at the 0.05 level. An OR value >1.0 indicates a positive association between pSS and the variables tested. To determine the associations between psychopathology variables and pSS, multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression after adjustment for personality variables that are found to be significant in the univariate model (without presenting inter-correlations) and demographics (marital status, occupational status and educational level). To define the associations between psychopathology variables and pSS prognostic type (Type I vs Type II), an analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney U-test. The individual associations of psychopathology variables with clinical and laboratory parameters (as categorical variables) of the disease were also evaluated using ORs and their corresponding 95% CIs, followed by a multivariate analysis (adjusting for age and sex) using logistic regression. Comparison with titres of autoAbs against hypothalamic and pituitary neuropeptides (as numerical variables of the optical density in ELISA) in pSS patients and controls was performed by using the Mann–Whitney U-test. The associations between levels of hypothalamic and pituitary neuropeptides and psychopathology and personality scores were estimated with Spearman’s ρ correlation. The associations of psychopathology variables (as numerical variables) with neuropeptide autoAbs (as numerical variables), taking into account the different groups (pSS and controls) were estimated by comparison with regression models. This model fits regression lines for one predictor at each level of a second predictor and tests for significant differences between the intercepts and the slopes. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical program package and GLIM 3.77 (Royal Statistical Society, London, UK).

Factor 1 The first factor examines if your work is commercial or non-commercial and also if it is transformative. Works that are non-commercial are more likely to be fair use than commercial works, but if you have ads on your YouTube channel or website that is enough to be considered commercial use. Commercial use can be fair use, it’s just less likely. The first factor also looks at transformativeness, which is the degree to which you transform the copyrighted work you’re using. There are many ways to transform video, but a good rule of thumb is that the transformed work should serve a different purpose than the original work. For example, let’s say you take a bunch of short clips from a long running TV show and mashed them up into a new story that showed how the much beloved main character is actually remarkably racist. That would likely be transformative use. Factor 2 The second factor examines whether a work is published or unpublished and also looks at whether the work is factual or creative. Unpublished works are typically given more protection, so any time material is leaked, it is less likely to be fair use. As for the second part, facts are not eligible for copyright protection. Therefore, the reuse of factual works is more likely to be fair use than the reuse of creative works. Factor 3 The third factor checks how much of the work you used and what part of the work you used. In general, the less you use the better; however, there are times where using a small amount of work is less likely to be fair use. If you use the key moment of a work (like re-posting the minute of American Idol where they announce the winner), do not transform it, and post it by itself it is far less likely to be fair use. Factor 4 The fourth factor looks determines if your video is a market replacement for the video. For example, if you re-posted a music video on your channel your re-post is a direct replacement for the original, it is less likely to be fair use.
Maria Fyodorovna Dostoevskaya Mikhail Andreyevich Dostoevsky Dostoevsky's parents were part of a multi-ethnic and multi-denominational noble family, its branches including Russian Orthodox Christians, Polish Roman Catholics and Ukrainian Eastern Catholics.[4] The family traced its roots back to a Tatar, Aslan Chelebi-Murza, who in 1389 defected from the Golden Horde and joined the forces of Dmitry Donskoy, the first prince of Muscovy to openly challenge the Mongol authority in the region,[5] and whose descendant, Danilo Irtishch, was ennobled and given lands in the Pinsk region (for centuries part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, now in modern-day Belarus) in 1509 for his services under a local prince, his progeny then taking the name "Dostoevsky" based on a village there called Dostoïevo.[6] Dostoevsky's immediate ancestors on his mother's side were merchants; the male line on his father's side were priests. His father, Mikhail Andreevich, was expected to join the clergy but instead ran away from home and broke with the family permanently. In 1809, the 20-year-old Mikhail Andreevich Dostoevsky enrolled in Moscow's Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy. From there he was assigned to a Moscow hospital, where he served as military doctor, and in 1818, he was appointed a senior physician. In 1819 he married Maria Nechayeva. The following year, he took up a post at the Mariinsky Hospital for the poor. In 1828, when his two sons, Mikhail and Fyodor, were eight and seven respectively, he was promoted to collegiate assessor, a position which raised his legal status to that of the nobility and enabled him to acquire a small estate in Darovoye, a town about 150 km (100 miles) from Moscow, where the family usually spent the summers. Dostoevsky's parents subsequently had six more children: Varvara (1822–1892), Andrei (1825–1897), Lyubov (born and died 1829), Vera (1829–1896), Nikolai (1831–1883) and Aleksandra (1835–1889).[11]
Fyodor Dostoevsky, born on 11 November [O.S. 30 October] 1821, was the second child of Dr. Mikhail Dostoevsky and Maria Dostoevskaya (born Nechayeva). He was raised in the family home in the grounds of the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, which was in a lower class district on the edges of Moscow. Dostoevsky encountered the patients, who were at the lower end of the Russian social scale, when playing in the hospital gardens. Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age. From the age of three, he was read heroic sagas, fairy tales and legends by his nanny, Alena Frolovna, an especially influential figure in his upbringing and love for fictional stories. When he was four his mother used the Bible to teach him to read and write. His parents introduced him to a wide range of literature, including Russian writers Karamzin, Pushkin and Derzhavin; Gothic fiction such as Ann Radcliffe; romantic works by Schiller and Goethe; heroic tales by Cervantes and Walter Scott; and Homer's epics. Although his father's approach to education has been described as strict and harsh, Dostoevsky himself reports that his imagination was brought alive by nightly readings by his parents. Some of his childhood experiences found their way into his writings. When a nine-year-old girl had been raped by a drunk, he was asked to fetch his father to attend to her. The incident haunted him, and the theme of the desire of a mature man for a young girl appears in The Devils, The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, and other writings. An incident involving a family servant, or serf, in the estate in Darovoye, is described in "The Peasant Marey": when the young Dostoevsky imagines hearing a wolf in the forest, Marey, who is working nearby, comforts him.[19] Although Dostoevsky had a delicate physical constitution, his parents described him as hot-headed, stubborn and cheeky. In 1833, Dostoevsky's father, who was profoundly religious, sent him to a French boarding school and then to the Chermak boarding school. He was described as a pale, introverted dreamer and an over-excitable romantic. To pay the school fees, his father borrowed money and extended his private medical practice. Dostoevsky felt out of place among his aristocratic classmates at the Moscow school, and the experience was later reflected in some of his works, notably The Adolescent.
Dostoevsky as a military engineer On 27 September 1837 Dostoevsky's mother died of tuberculosis. The previous May, his parents had sent Dostoevsky and his brother Mikhail to St Petersburg to attend the free Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute, forcing the brothers to abandon their academic studies for military careers. Dostoevsky entered the academy in January 1838, but only with the help of family members. Mikhail was refused admission on health grounds and was sent to the Academy in Reval, Estonia. Dostoevsky disliked the academy, primarily because of his lack of interest in science, mathematics and military engineering and his preference for drawing and architecture. As his friend Konstantin Trutovsky once said, "There was no student in the entire institution with less of a military bearing than F.M. Dostoevsky. He moved clumsily and jerkily; his uniform hung awkwardly on him; and his knapsack, shako and rifle all looked like some sort of fetter he had been forced to wear for a time and which lay heavily on him." Dostoevsky's character and interests made him an outsider among his 120 classmates: he showed bravery and a strong sense of justice, protected newcomers, aligned himself with teachers, criticised corruption among officers and helped poor farmers. Although he was solitary and inhabited his own literary world, he was respected by his classmates. His reclusiveness and interest in religion earned him the nickname "Monk Photius". Signs of Dostoevsky's epilepsy may have first appeared on learning of the death of his father on 16 June 1839, although the reports of a seizure originated from accounts written by his daughter (later expanded by Sigmund Freud.[29]) which are now considered to be unreliable. His father's official cause of death was an apoplectic stroke, but a neighbour, Pavel Khotiaintsev, accused the father's serfs of murder. Had the serfs been found guilty and sent to Siberia, Khotiaintsev would have been in a position to buy the vacated land. The serfs were acquitted in a trial in Tula, but Dostoevsky's brother Andrei perpetuated the story. After his father's death, Dostoevsky continued his studies, passed his exams and obtained the rank of engineer cadet, entitling him to live away from the academy. He visited Mikhail in Reval, and frequently attended concerts, operas, plays and ballets. During this time, two of his friends introduced him to gambling. On 12 August 1843 Dostoevsky took a job as a lieutenant engineer and lived with Adolph Totleben in an apartment owned by Dr. Rizenkampf, a friend of Mikhail. Rizenkampf characterised him as "no less good-natured and no less courteous than his brother, but when not in a good mood he often looked at everything through dark glasses, became vexed, forgot good manners, and sometimes was carried away to the point of abusiveness and loss of self-awareness". Dostoevsky's first completed literary work, a translation of Honoré de Balzac's novel Eugénie Grandet, was published in June and July 1843 in the 6th and 7th volume of the journal Repertoire and Pantheon,[34] followed by several other translations. None were successful, and his financial difficulties led him to write a novel.
Dostoevsky on his bier , drawing by Ivan Kramskoi, 1881 Dostoevsky's grave in Saint Petersburg On 25 January 1881, while searching for members of the terrorist organisation Narodnaya Volya ("The People's Will") who would soon assassinate Tsar Alexander II, the Tsar's secret police executed a search warrant in the apartment of one of Dostoevsky's neighbours[citation needed]. On the following day, Dostoevsky suffered a pulmonary haemorrhage. Anna denied that the search had caused it, saying that the haemorrhage had occurred after her husband had been looking for a dropped pen holder.[f] After another haemorrhage, Anna called the doctors, who gave a poor prognosis. A third haemorrhage followed shortly afterwards. While seeing his children before dying, Dostoevsky requested that the parable of the Prodigal Son be read to his children. The profound meaning of this request is pointed out by Frank: It was this parable of transgression, repentance, and forgiveness that he wished to leave as a last heritage to his children, and it may well be seen as his own ultimate understanding of the meaning of his life and the message of his work.[109] Among Dostoevsky's last words was his quotation of Matthew 3:14–15: "But John forbad him, saying, I have a need to be baptised of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness", and he finished with "Hear now—permit it. Do not restrain me!" When he died, his body was placed on a table, following Russian custom. He was interred in the Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Convent,[111] near his favourite poets, Nikolay Karamzin and Vasily Zhukovsky. It is unclear how many attended his funeral. According to one reporter, more than 100,000 mourners were present, while others describe attendance between 40,000 and 50,000. His tombstone is inscribed with lines from the New Testament: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it dies, it bringeth forth much fruit. John 12:24
*Editor's note - Initial information from deputies indicated that the man fell on Friday. They have since said it happened Sunday.Gov. Mary Fallin on Thursday asked Oklahoma’s Health Care Authority to cut its contracts with two Planned Parenthood affiliates, citing high rates of billing errors. The request by Ms. Fallin, a Republican, comes as Republican governors of several states have moved to cut funding for Planned Parenthood after an anti-abortion group released videos that it said showed Planned Parenthood officials negotiating prices for fetal tissues from abortions. Planned Parenthood has said that the videos were heavily edited and has said it does not profit from fetal tissue donation. Nico Gomez, the chief executive of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, said his office would not take any action until it completed an audit. In 2015, Oklahoma paid the two Planned Parenthood affiliates $100,145 for 19,546 claims. A review showed no improper use of Medicaid funds, but showed a billing error rate of 20.3 percent rate at one and 14.2 percent at the other, the governor’s office said. Officials with Iowa-based Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, which operates a clinic in Tulsa, called the move "premature and incredibly disappointing." Ms. Fallin said ending the contracts with the two affiliates, which operate in six locations in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, would not interfere with a woman’s ability to have a choice of health care.Beaver Island as we know it first appeared out of the ice eleven thousand years ago. Since then, its form has changed considerably because of the rise and fall of Lake Michigan, which has ranged over a differential of 375'. The Lake dropped to a very low level about 8,000 years ago, and stayed down for 4,000 years. During this time, this land was not an island at all but an appendage of the mainland. Then the Lake rose to 30' above its present level, submerging all of Beaver except the central plateau. Next, it dropped about ten feet, producing a slightly smaller version of our present Island. The edge of this configuration was layered with beach gravel. When a logging railroad was built in 1904, it was placed on this firm bed. We know that Native Americans passed by Beaver Island as long ago as 2,200 years. There is no proof that they lived here, but the oral tradition of the Odawas, who have resided here for over 300 years, is that there were small fishing villages in many of the bays when they arrived. Arrowheads, spear heads, and fragments of Woodland-period pottery indicate that at least they came ashore. Fire-cracked rocks mark their cooking fires along the bluff. In 1871 the archeologist Henry Gillman opened some of the mounds in the harbor, and was surprised at the "uncommonly skillful workmanship" of the artifacts he found. The Odawas (Ottawas) migrated westward in the ripples of Native American movement that retreated from contact with the whites, arriving on Beaver Island in the mid-1700s. At times they were recruited to help in skirmishes between the English and the French, but little was known about their lives until Father Baraga came from L'Arbre Croche in 1832 to convert the Indians living on the north shore to Catholicism. He baptized 22 Indians, but those living in the settlement near Whiskey Point remained pagan. A few years later, some of the 199 Indians living on Garden Island, 2 miles north (and the site of over 3,000 Indian graves), were converted by other missionaries.
James Strang, who would create America's only kingdom on Beaver Island, was born in New York in 1813. He expected great things of himself. He established a law practice at the age of 23, but it failed to satisfy his ambition. When he met Joseph Smith in 1844, he converted to his new evangelical religion as a way of improving his position. Strang's debating skills impressed the Mormon leader, who assigned him to found a branch in Burlington, Wisconsin. While Strang was away, Smith was killed. Shortly thereafter Strang produced a letter naming him as Smith's chosen heir. He was challenged by Brigham Young, who was more solidly entrenched. Strang led those who accepted him to Nauvoo, Illinois, and then Voree, Wisconsin, before deciding that God wanted him to bring his flock to Beaver Island. Producing mysterious brass plates from the ground, and receiving directives from God, Strang formed a colony on Beaver Island in 1848. It grew year by year, and soon had the numbers to elect Strang to the state legislature. Trouble with the "gentiles" led to the "War of Whiskey Point", which the Mormons won by firing a canon at the unruly gang gathered at the trading post. By the early 1850s, most of the non-Mormons had left the Island. The ensuing degree of absolute power went to Strang's head, and rumors spread about Mormon attrocities. Strang had himself crowned king, and began taking additional wives. Attempts to oust him by legal means failed, and in 1856 he was assassinated by two disgruntled follow ers. His people were driven off the Island by an unruly mob from Mackinac Island, which was instigated by speculators eager to grab the land. During their 8-year occupancy, the Mormons cleared and cultivated the ground, built roads and houses, and changed the Island from a wilderness to a moderate outpost of civilization. But fate conspired to keep them from reaping the benefits of their toil.
Beaver Island was blessed to be near some of the best fishing grounds in the world. The Mormons had excluded the gentiles from partaking in this bounty, but once the Mormons were gone, Irish fishermen began to appear. They came from Gull Island, Mackinac Island, various port cities on the mainland, and County Donegal in Ireland. Once they settled in, they wrote to their families and friends about "America's Emerald Isle." Over the following three decades, the population grew in surges, taking on a decidedly Irish flavor. Ordinary conversations, as well as services in the Catholic Church, were conducted in Gaelic. Of the 881 residents in 1880, there were 141 Gallaghers, 123 Boyles, and 90 O'Donnells recorded in the census. Closely knit, isolated from the rest of the world during the winter, this community developed a unique identity. Because they controlled the nearby fishing grounds, the economy thrived. By the mid 1880s Beaver Island had become the largest supplier of fresh-water fish in the country. But the invention (1872) and proliferation of the steam tug posed a severe threat. Suddenly fishermen from mainland ports could cross to the grounds, lay five miles of nets, and cross back before dark. No sooner had the Island fishermen adjusted to the loss of their monopoly than a second blow befell them: a sudden drastic reduction in the supply of fish, starting in 1886. Due to overfishing, the harvest declined to half its previous rate by 1893. This problem affected the entire Great Lakes. Michigan started a hatcheries program. This helped, but not enough, so in 1897 a law closing the season during the fall spawning period was passed. The Beaver Island fisherman, notoriously independent, announced that this did not apply to them, so in 1898 a warden was dispatched. He leased a boat in Charlevoix and headed for the Island in the first no-fishing week. A fisherman who was out lifting his nets by the light of the moon saw the warden approach. He tried to flee, but the warden, firing on him with a "Winchester cannon," gave chase. Eventually the fisherman's boat was too damaged to continue, and he was caught and arrested and his equipment confiscated. This became known as "the Battle of the Beavers." Islanders' intractability was reduced, but streaks of it could still be observed for the next hundred years.
Beaver Island has had more than its share of charismatic personalities, such as Father Peter Gallagher and "Doctor" Protar. Father Gallagher became the Island priest in 1865. A man of the people, he quickly came to dominate Island life. He settled disputes, loaned money, arranged marriages, carried on with the bachelors, acquired vast holdings, owned the merchant ship Hattie Fisher, and became an avid hunter and fisherman. He won a pair of horses in a marksmanship contest, and challenged a man to a fistfight in the St. Ignatius chapel, forcing its closure by drawing blood. When the Bishop tried to have him removed, the Bishop's men were threatened by the priest's flock. He was always a figure of controversy, but was generally respected and loved until he died in 1898. Feodor Protar had almost the opposite temperament. Arriving five years before Father Gallagher's death, this newspaper editor and talented actor wanted to change his life in order to undertake a spiritual quest. He bought an old cabin on Sloptown Road, where he strove for self-sufficiency. He did everything he could for everyone he met, including performing medical services for those too poor or too distant for the doctor in St. James. Despite his objections, he was known as "Doctor Protar." Somewhat of a recluse, and a follower of the precepts of Tolstoy, this elderly immigrant came to be regarded as a saint. When he died in 1925, his admirers built a stone-and-iron tomb on Bonner's Bluff for their "heaven-sent friend."
Despite the Island's poor soil, farming played an important role because of the cost of shipping. Farms near Four Corners and on Sloptown Road, many in fields cleared by the Mormons, operated from the 1860s until the 1950s. In addition, excess crops from the Israelite farms on High Island in the 1910s and 20s were sold on the streets of St. James. Logging too has always played a role, with small groups providing cordwood, cedar ties, and tan bark, but in 1901 the Beaver Island Lumber Company went into business in a way that dwarfed all of the other operations before and since. They hired 125 men, bought and built a complex of docks, erected a mill, and built housing on Freesoil Avenue, some of which still stands. They ran a track to Donegal Bay and then south for over ten miles, and had three steam engines hauling carloads of logs to their mill. Ships picked up shaves, shingles, boards, and slabwood and took these products to Detroit and Chicago. The overloaded trains pushed sideways as they rounded the many curves, widening the tracks. Derailments were common. One time a train tipped over, crushing the engineer. Just as some of those who had built the Island's two lighthouses or worked at the Coast Guard station had stayed after their job was done, so too did some of the loggers when the Lumber Company closed its operation and picked up its tracks in 1916. At the turn of the century the population of the Island began to develop more variety. Father Zugelder, the German priest who replaced Father Gallagher, was well-accepted into the diversifying community.
The improvements being implemented in other communities in the early part of this century came late to Beaver Island. In 1905 the Island was connected to the mainland with a 200-ton telegraph cable. Regular winter mail service was not instituted until 1926; before that, it was dependent on dog- and horse-sled trips across the ice. A power plant was built in 1939, and Island homes finally could have electricity. Previously the Parish Hall, the Beaver Hotel, and the Coast Guard Station had installed their own small generators. Perhaps because of this backwardness, the Island was always a popular destination for those tourists who were willing to rough it in their search for a more pristine lifestyle. Local merchants promoted tourism as early as 1878. Fast-talking developers sold Island lots in the lobbies of Chicago hotels in the early 1900s. Tracts of beach on the Island's east side were turned into lots for vacation cottages in the 1920s and 30s. Despite this boost, the Island's economy was still dependent on commercial fishing. The harbor at St. James was ringed with docks, net sheds, ice houses, and boat-building sheds. When the lamprey eel began to decimate the trout and whitefish population in the 1940s, the Island was in trouble. It had been losing population anyway as the newer generations went off to make their mark in the world, particularly in Chicago, but now almost everyone left. The once-thriving community of well over 1,000 residents dwindled to less than 200, and people were afraid the school and medical center would be closed and they would all have to leave. But in the late 1970s a new wave of tourism reversed this trend. As the economy of Michigan improved, along with the pressure and tension of taking advantage of it, more and more people discovered Beaver Island, fell in love with it, and bought property or a home. Today, construction is the dominant industry, with carpenters as plentiful as fishermen once were. After years of insularity, during which ideas offered by newcomers were sneered at, the Island residents have become much more accepting of notions from outside. The newcomers have helped raise the standard of living, and made life more interesting, Yesterday's backwardness has given way to an enlightened infrastructure, with progressive planning commissions, an active Chamber of Commerce, Historical Society, Preservation Association, Property Owners' Association, volunteer fire department, and a well-trained emergency medical service. And the time-honored tradition of picking up news at the bar has been replaced, to a great extent, by searching the internet. Daily activities have come to closely resemble those of the mainland, with the primary difference being that they are enacted in a distant place that is proud of its unique and variegated natural endowment.The results of recent controlled trials documenting the protective effect of male circumcision on HIV infection in young adults pose significant challenges to a country like Israel. Circumcision is performed in close to 100% of new born males, mostly as a religious act in Judaism and Islam. Christian Israelis follow societal norms suggesting that circumcision contributes to better hygiene and cleanliness. Complications in infant circumcision in Israel are rare, despite the surgery being preformed most often by nonmedical circumcisers (a "Mohel") on the eighth day of birth. Reported complication rates are between 0.34% and 2%, with bleeding and infections being the most common. In the last 10 years and due to massive migration of Eastern Europeans into Israel, impressive experience was gained in Israel with adults seeking male circumcision for various reasons including: religious, societal pressure, sexual and economical. Over 21,800 adult male circumcisions have been monitored between 1998 and 2006 alone. Complication rates (mostly bleeding) were 1.75% on an average. This review matches the new data emerging from the African controlled trials with previous observational studies and the Jewish and Israeli experience. We present three challenges to policy makers in Israel: (a) the need to intensify education and information sharing on male circumcision and HIV/AIDS among healthcare workers; (b) developing an information campaign for non-circumcised migrants and adequate service to scale up on potential demand; (c) developing intensified educational campaigns for circumcised males so that they do not abandon other protective interventions (e.g. condoms) when needed for HIV prevention.(Steven Nelson for USN&WR)
With that out of the way, let me get into the meat of this article, which is, as the title suggests, a short lesson on a few of the more egregious lies connected with the global warming scam. Just a day spent on the Internet doing due diligence on this topic with an open mind will convince anyone with half a brain that global warming is a criminal shakedown of historic proportions. Rather than go at the topic of global warming with hammer and tongs I will just briefly visit a few of its more popular talking points – simply to steer any interested readers in a profitable direction. The Science is Settled Balderdash! (My inner editor/censor instantly popped to attention at my initial, sadly deleted, remark and insisted on a quick fix). The science (and “science”) surrounding global warming, or climate change, or whatever the term du jour is, is NOT settled – it is, in fact, far from being settled. This is as good a place as any to point out that the word science does not possess the hard and fast definition that most of us think it does. There is a whole branch of philosophy that deals with just that question – what science is, and what it is not. This is a topic that is apt to induce a bout of narcolepsy in a number of my readers, so I will hurry on and wrap this segment up. Let me just say that if we accept a very general definition of science – that it is a search for what is true and factual in the physical realm – then most of the “science” behind global warming is no science at all. It is agenda-driven pseudo-science—not true open-minded scientific research so much as an attempt to funnel findings down a profitable (and prestigious) channel to a predetermined end.
Is climate change a real phenomenon? Of course. No sensible person would argue otherwise. But is it primarily caused by humanity, or are other factors more to blame, such as electromagnetic solar activity and radiation, volcanic eruptions, oceans, and so forth? After studying some of the various deceitful ploys used by global warming “scientists” over the years, I simply no longer trust their word about anything. Which is a shame, because I have no doubt that many, perhaps most, of the scientists promoting man-made climate change are sincerely concerned about the earth. That doesn’t mean that they are right though, and it does not excuse the many lies used to force-feed us global warming. Carbon Dioxide is a Dangerous Pollutant Balderdash again! NEWS FLASH: The earth has experienced much higher carbon dioxide levels in the past—long before any “Industrial Revolution.” The idea that increased CO2 levels are something new, or inextricably linked to fossil fuels alone is simply rubbish. Periodically, carbon dioxide levels have been considerably higher throughout earth’s long history, and humanity didn’t have a darn thing to do with it. And what’s more, the increased CO2 levels did not ruin the planet. In fact, plant life flourishes under increased CO2 levels. If carbon dioxide is truly a dangerous pollutant, then the earth would have suffered grievously eons ago.
Climate Change “Climate change” is a bland generic label that can mean anything, and therefore means nothing. Does weather change? Of course it does—yesterday it was raining and today it’s sunny. What’s your point? The point, such as it is, is to have a term so amorphous that it can cover any eventuality. If the climate gets warmer, that’s climate change; if it gets colder, that’s climate change too. All bases covered—it’s a wonderful thing, if you’re into spineless duplicity. I recall when the term “climate change” first gained wide popularity, around the year 2012 or so. Until then all we had heard about was “global warming” or AGW (Anthropocentric Global Warming). Then it got colder, and when those pesky temperatures started dropping, the AGW “scientists” put on their thinking caps and explained to us how things were getting colder because they were getting hotter. The globalist faithful accepted this dubious proposition at face value, but the rest of us scratched our heads and thought “Hmm, I don’t think that makes sense actually.” So, going back to the drawing board the “scientists” came up with the generic, one-size-fits-all, term “climate change.” “Just you try denying that one!” Don’t buy into their hogwash though—it’s just the same old crapola in a new container, that’s all.
Climate Change Deniers Are Guilty of Hate Speech First of all, as I point out above, no one is saying that the weather doesn’t change. I’ll gladly swear on a stack of Bibles that, yes, the weather does indeed change from time to time. I noticed that all on my own some years back. What is in question, however, is the hypothesis that climate change is primarily caused by carbon dioxide, fossil fuels, and/or humanity as a whole. Also, there is no doubt that climate change “science” has put its thumb on the scale in order to promote its one-sided and debatable claims. That is not hate speech. It is simply what common sense, logic, and due diligence have shown me to be the truth. Unfortunately, the truth is all too often obscured and twisted, when it is not being ignored or hidden, by the more nefarious proponents of AGW. If I were to engage in hate speech you would know it, trust me. You would have no doubt whatsoever about where I was coming from. The truth is only “hate speech” to those who hate the truth—a simple meme, but nonetheless true. Conclusion I will conclude by saying that I thank God every day that we have a president who cares more about what is good for the United States and its citizens then catering to political correctness and kissing globalist butt. May God continue to guide, bless, and protect President Trump, his family, and his aides.
North Carolina State will not be a fun team to face this weekend in the Raleigh Regional. The Wolfpack finished the regular season and conference tournament with a very impressive 18-10 mark vs. RPI Top 50 teams, but were snubbed out of a national seed, with Oregon getting the nod for the No. 8 spot. N.C. State's starting rotation has been kind of a revolving door this season, but keep an eye on imposing left-handed pitcher Carlos Rodon, who was up to 93 in the ninth inning last weekend against North Carolina, and had his usual devastating 83-85 slider working extremely well, particularly in on right-handed hitters. Left-handed pitcher Brad Stone is a tall lanky-framed guy who has shown flashes of greatness this season, making his 5.81 ERA rather deceptive, while Logan Jernigan was in the rotation last weekend and has a 1.07 ERA in 25 1/3 innings of work. Meanwhile, the strength of this team is the bullpen with quality arms such as Grant Sasser (1.18, 29 IP), Josh Easley (1.62), Andrew Woeck (2.86) and Ryan Wilkins (4.00) leading the charge. Also keep an eye on consistent closer Chris Overman, who doesn't have overpowering stuff, but is a bulldog who throws strikes. Meanwhile, from an offensive standpoint, the Wolfpack have the potential to put up some runs if they get on a roll. Third baseman Grant Clyde, who's hitting .291 with four homers and 24 RBIs has been solid lately, while shortstop Trea Turner leads the way with a .376 batting average, six homers, 40 RBIs, and of course, 24 stolen bases in 30 attempts. Bryan Adametz and Jake Fincher also are tough hitters, while imposing Tarran Senay, who's hitting .284 with six homers and 49 RBIs, has good power and is a run producer.
As usually seems to be the case, the Rebels are a rather frustrating team this season. After losing several key cogs from last year's team at the plate, the Rebels appeared to be a team ready to move forward earlier in the season. However, they've been struggling at the plate and enter the postseason hitting .276. Catcher Stuart Tuner is a bright spot both offensively and defensively, hitting an impressive .381 with 15 doubles, five homers and 50 RBIs, while third baseman Andrew Mistone (.316/0/34) and Austin Anderson (.300/3/38) also have been impressive at times. Speedy outfielder Tanner Mathis must rise to the occasion this weekend, while the same can be said for sophomore Auston Bousfield, who's hitting just .262 with two homers and 24 RBIs. Pitching-wise, the Rebels have the ability to be outstanding with right-handed starting pitchers Bobby Wahl and Mike Mayers in charge. Both Wahl and Mayers will throw anywhere from 92-94, with Wahl touching some 95s on the radar gun. Mayers was impressive in the SEC tournament, perhaps serving a springboard to the postseason. Meanwhile, right-handed pitcher Sam Smith has been solid at times this season and gets up to 90 with his fastball, while in the bullpen, Brett Huber, Matt Denny, Tanner Bailey and Aaron Greenwood give the Rebels a reliable quartet.
After Jon Arryn died, Queen Cersei managed to convince King Robert to name her brother Jaime Lannister as the Warden of the East, because Jon's only son and heir Robert "Sweetrobin" Arryn is just a child. This greatly angered many lords in the Vale because Jaime has no connection to House Arryn or the Vale, so they begin to defiantly refer to Sweetrobin as the "True Warden of the East". Ned Stark is also opposed to Robert's decree because it puts the armies of two regions under command of a single house. Jaime, however, never actually travels to the Vale or makes any attempt to take command of the Vale's armies during these few months, and thus his hold on the title was nominal. Jaime continues to technically hold the position while he spent a full year as a prisoner of the Starks after the Battle of the Whispering Wood, although his imprisonment meant that the position was left officially vacant. The title of Warden of the East is restored to Sweetrobin by Tywin Lannister as one of the conditions of the marriage-alliance between Lysa and Petyr Baelish which brings House Arryn back into the Lannister fold. The TV series omitted this entire subplot.
After two separate releases of Merchant Of Salt , on Sandwell District and Eaux, Rrose has now chosen to expose the record's B-side, "Waterfall," in its foetal form: a newly issued "Birth" mix, included here on, was actually recorded before the version released two years ago. It now arrives with a remix by Stroboscopic Artefacts' Lucy, and supplemented by a new Rrose track, "Shrouds."While the well-known original was based on a gradual blossoming of a corrosive synth that built to an orgasmic peak, the "Birth" version has space for haunting atonal murmurs that add a sense of hallucinatory ambience. Halfway through, the ghastly cries take center stage, giving an almost Boards Of Canada-like eeriness to the finish. The Lucy remix is a slow-and-steady march, made memorable by sporadic guitar-like synth hits and waves of visceral noise. The artist's signature conjuration of sophisticated sonic textures is unmistakeable during the intro and outro of the track, making these often overlooked sections perhaps the most interesting. "Shrouds" is lo-fi with starkly minimalistic percussion. Calling to mind the earlier works of Regis, it's uncharacteristically dark for Rrose.On Sunday, former US ambassador to the UN and recent Trump deputy secretary of state appointee, John Bolton, challenged the primary intelligence-gathering agency of the United States government, arguing that reports of Russian hacking during the presidential election may not be what they seem.

Combine the 3 tbsp of ground chia with the 1/2 cup of water in a bowl and set aside. Wash & cook the chickpeas until they are super soft (you will have to mash them by hand, so the softer they are the easier it will be for you). Once the chickpeas are cooked, drain any excess water and set aside. Grease a baking sheet and preheat oven to 400. Chop the green onion, fresh cilantro and greens, if using, and set aside. Now it’s time to use your mom arms, yoga arms or if you are like me, your slightly weakling arms. 🙂 With a potato masher (or fork if you don’t have a masher), mash the chickpeas. You want to mash them just until you can’t see any more whole chickpeas. You still want them to keep their form. You don’t want to use a food processor because they will get too soft and won’t form properly into patties. Add all of the spices and the chia mixture to the chickpeas and mix with a spoon until everything is nicely combined. Using a 1/3 measuring cup, scoop up the chickpea mixture and place onto your greased baking sheet. Use your fingers to flatten your patties until they are about 2-3 inches thick. Bake at 400 for about 30-40 minutes, flipping them mid-way through. Enjoy them in your salad, in your burger, in a wrap or on their own! You can pan fry them right before you eat them so that they are nice and crispy. These freeze really well, so feel free to wrap them up and freeze them once they are cool.Partisans of the Left compulsively claim President George W. Bush was an imbecile who couldn’t be trusted on anything. If they’re right, all of us must reflexively and wholly refute every statement he ever made. It would seem very reasonable, then, to first dispense with a sweeping pronouncement on one of the most pressing and thorny issues of modern times, an issue that obviously no Texan troglodyte could hope to grasp: “The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That’s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.” Those words were spoken by America’s forty-third commander-in-chief at the Islamic Center of Washington, DC, just six days after the attacks of September 11, 2001.
Although people long ago began to wonder whether the "canals" on Mars were the creation of cosmic engineers, for some odd reason it has not occurred to look with the same eyes upon the peculiarities of the lunar landscape much closer at hand.And all the arguments about the possibilities of intelligent life existing on other celestial bodies have been confined to the idea that other civilizations must necessarily live on the surface of a planet, and that the interior as a habitat is out of the question. Abandoning the traditional paths of "common sense", we have plunged into what may at first sight seem to be unbridled and irresponsible fantasy.But the more minutely we go into all the information gathered by man about the Moon, the more we are convinced that there is not a single fact to rule out our supposition.Not only that, but many things so far considered to be lunar enigmas are explainable in the light of this new hypothesis.The origin of the Moon is one of the most complicated problems of cosmogony. So far there have been basically three hypotheses under discussion.The Moon was once a part of the Earth and broke away from it. This has now been refuted by the evidence.The Moon was formed independently from the same cloud of dust and gas as the Earth, and immediately became the Earth's natural satellite.But then why is there such a big difference between the specific gravity of the Moon (3.33 grams per cubic centimeter) and that of the Earth (5.5 gr.)?Furthermore, according to the latest information (analysis of samples brought back by the U.S. Apollo astronauts) lunar rock is not of the same composition as the Earth's.The Moon came into being separately, and, moreover, far from the Earth (perhaps even outside the Solar system).This would mean that the moon would not have to be fashioned from the same "clay" as our own planet. Sailing through the Universe, the Moon came into Earth's proximity, and by a complex interplay of forces of gravity was brought within a geocentric orbit, very close to circular. But a catch of this kind is virtually impossible.In fact, scientists studying the origin of the Universe today have no acceptable theory to explain how the Earth-Moon system came into being.We refuse to engage in speculation about who exactly staged this unique experiment, which only a highly developed civilization was capable of.If you are going to launch an artificial sputnik, then it is advisable to make it hollow.At the same time it would be naive to imagine that anyone capable of such a tremendous space project would be satisfied simply with some kind of giant empty trunk hurled into a near-Earth trajectory.It is more likely that what we have here is a very ancient spaceship, the interior of which was filled with fuel for the engines, materials and appliances for repair work, navigation, instruments, observation equipment and all manner of machinery...In other words, everything necessary to enable this "caravelle of the Universe" to serve as a kind of Noah's Ark of intelligence, perhaps even as the home of a whole civilization envisaging a prolonged (thousands of millions of years) existence and long wanderings through space (thousands of millions of miles).Naturally, the hull of such a spaceship must be super-tough in order to stand up to the blows of meteorites and sharp fluctuations between extreme heat and extreme cold.Probably the shell is a double-layered affair--the basis a dense armoring of about 20 miles in thickness, and outside it some kind of more loosely packed covering (a thinner layer — averaging about three miles).In certain areas — where the lunar "seas" and "craters" are, the upper layer is quite thin, in some cases, non-existent.Since the Moon's diameter is 2,162 miles, then looked at from our point of view it is a thin- walled sphere.And, understandably, not an empty one. There could be all kinds of materials and equipment on its inner surface.But the greatest proportion of the lunar mass is concentrated in the central part of the sphere, in its core, which has a diameter of 2,062 miles.Thus the distance between the kernel and the shell of this nut is in the region of 30 miles. This space was doubtless filled with gases required for breathing, and for technological and other purposes.With such an internal structure the Moon could have an average specific gravity if 3.3 grams per cubic centimeter, which differs considerably from that of Earth (5.5 grams per cubic centimeter).The most numerous and interesting of the formations on the lunar surface are the craters.In diameter they vary considerably. Some are less that a yard across, while others are more than 120 miles (the biggest has a diameter of 148 miles). How does the Moon come to be so pockmarked?There are two hypothesis — volcanic and meteoric. Most scientists vote for the latter.Kirill Stanyukovich, a Soviet physicist, has written a whole series of works since 1937 in which he expounds the idea that the craters are the result of bombardment of the Moon for millions of years.And he really means bombardment, for even the smallest celestial body, when it is involved in one of those fastest head-on collisions so common in the cosmos behaves itself like a warhead charged with dynamite, or even an atomic warhead at times.Instant combustion takes place on impact, turning it into a dense cloud of incandescent gas, into plasma, and there is a very definite explosion.According to Professor Stanyukovich, a "missile" of a sizable character (say 6 miles in diameter) must, on collision with the Moon, penetrate to a depth equal to 4 or 5 times its own diameter (24-30 miles).The surprising thing is that however big the meteorites may have been which have fallen on the Moon (some have been more than 60 miles in diameter), and however fast they must have been traveling (in some cases the combined speed was as much as 38 miles per second), the craters they have left behind are for some odd reason all about the same depth, 1.2-2 miles, although they vary tremendously in diameter.Take that 148-mile diameter crater. In area it outdoes Hiroshima hundreds of times over.What a powerful explosion it must have been to send millions of tons of lunar rock fountaining over tens of miles!On the face of it, one would expect to find a very deep crater here, but nothing of the sort: there is three miles at the most between top and bottom levels, and one third of that is accounted for by the wall of rock thrown up around the crater like a toothed crown.For such a big hole, it is too shallow. Furthermore, the bottom of the crater is convex, following the curve of the lunar surface.If you were to stand in the middle of the crater you would not even be able to see the soaring edge-- it would be beyond the horizon. A hollow that is more like a hill is a rather strange affair, perhaps.Not really, if one assumes that when the meteorite strikes the outer covering of the moon, this plays the role of a buffer and the foreign body finds itself up against an impenetrable spherical barrier.Only slightly denting the 20-mile layer of armour plating, the explosion flings bits of its "coating" far and wide.Bearing in mind that the Moon's defense coating is, according to our calculations, 2.5 miles thick, one sees that this is approximately the maximum depth of the craters.Now let us consider the chemical peculiarities of the lunar rock.Upon analysis, American scientists have found chromium, titanium and zirconium in it. These are all metals with refractory, mechanically strong and anti-corrosive properties.A combination of them all would have enviable resistance to heat and the ability to stand up to means of aggression, and could be used on Earth for linings for electrical furnaces.If a material had to be devised to protect a giant artificial satellite from the unfavorable effects of temperature, from cosmic radiation and meteorite bombardment, the experts would probably have hit on precisely these metals.In that case it is not clear why lunar rock is such an extraordinarily poor heat conductor - a factor which so amazed the astronauts? Wasn't that what the designers of the super-sputnik of the Earth were after?From the engineers point of view, this spaceship of ages long past which we call the Moon is superbly constructed. There may be a good reason for its extreme longevity. It is even possible that it predates our own planet.At any rate, some pieces of lunar rock have proved older than the oldest on Earth, although it is true, this applies to the age of the materials and not of the structure for which they were used.And from the number of craters on its surface, the Moon itself is no chicken.It is, of course, difficult to say when it began to shine in the sky above the Earth, but on the basis of some preliminary estimates one might hazard a guess that it was around two thousand million years ago.We do not, of course, imagine that the moon is still inhabited, and probably many of its automatic devices have stopped working, too. The stabilizers have ceased functioning and the poles have shifted.Even though the moon keeps that same side turned towards us, for some time it has been unsteady on its own axis, on occasion showing us part of its reverse side which were once invisible to observers on the Earth - for example, the Selenites themselves if they made expeditions here.Time has taken its toll. Both body and rigging have disintegrated to some extent; some seams on the inner shell evidently diverged.We assume that the long (up to 940 miles) chains of small craters formerly ascribed to volcanic activity were brought about by eruptions of gas through cracks appearing in the armour plating as a result of accidents.No doubt one of the most splendid features of the lunarscape — a straight "wall" nearly 500 yards high and over 60 miles long - formed as a result of one of the armor plates bending under the impact of celestial torpedoes and raising one of its straight, even edges.The Moon's population presumably took the necessary steps to remedy the effects of meteorite bombardment, for example, patching up rents in the outer shield covering the inner shell.For such purposes a substance from the lunar core was probably used, a kind a cement being made from it. After processing this would be piped to the surface sites where it was required.Not long ago astronomers discovered variations in the gravitational fields near the large "seas". We believe the reason to be this: the Moon's dry seas are in fact areas from which the protective coating was torn from the armor cladding.To make good the damage to these vast tracts, the installation producing the repair substance would have had to be brought immediately beneath the site so that it could flood the area with its "cement". The resulting flat stretches are what look like seas to the terrestrial observer.The stocks of materials and machinery for doing this are no doubt still where they were, and are sufficiently massive to give rise to these gravitational anomalies.What is the Moon today? Is it a colossal necropolis, a "city of the dead," where some form of life became extinct? Is it a kind cosmic Flying Dutchman? A craft abandoned by its crew and controlled automatically?We do not know and we shall not try to guess.We have put forward in this article only a few of the reasons - unfortunately the evidence is so far only circumstantial - for our hypothesis, which at first glance may appear to be crazy.A similar "crazy" idea was put forward in 1959 by Professor Iosif Shklovsky, an eminent scientist, in relation to the "moons" circling around Mars.After carefully weighing up the evidence he concludes that they are both hollow and therefore artificial satellites.We feel that the questions we have raised in connection with our Moon provide sufficient food for serious thought on the matter; the result may be the illumination of our many lunar riddles.Now, of course, we have to wait for direct evidence to support our idea. Or refute it...Probably there will not be long to wait.There’s Something Wrong With This Staten Island Church
Before jumping into Unity, it will be extremely important to get a good foundation in a programming language. Unity gives the option to choose from two separate languages, C# (pronounced c-sharp) and Java. We will outline a path to learn each one. All of our tutorials are in C# but honestly they are very similar so either one you choose will differ slightly in syntax. The easiest way we can recommend (and the way I first began learning programming) would be to start with a Learn C#/Java in 21 Days book. These are fantastic resources and break it up into manageable daily learning sessions, which also helps retain the information as well, because they have you do simple tasks to cement the concepts at the end of each daily lesson. At the end of 30 days you will have a very good understanding of the inner workings of that language and programming in general, because a lot of languages still follow the same structure, just using different syntax. Yes, it is completely possible to learn programming, or anything for that matter, online with free resources. Personally I recommend books because it saves time in searching for things and they are getting paid to put out good quality material all in one place, and are easy to reference later on when you need to remember what you did in specific situations. Plus you can’t go wrong investing in knowledge.
If religion seems so closely tied to the excesses of immorality and so readily abusive to its adherents, then how can one claim that religion is, in and of itself, moral? In Hitchens’ eyes the answer is clear, and if nothing else his attack should be enough to give any religious person cause for concern. I find this line of attack intriguing because it bypasses discussions of doctrine and attacks religion as an institution: a system with which people have a particular type of relationship. If any incarnate version of religion places people into a relationship of the type described by Hitchens, then it seems religion as practiced by most adherents is inherently immoral. Should one attempt to counter this assertion with a version of religion that does not resemble what has been previously described, I think Hitchens would argue that that thing would not be religion as normally defined and understood. If we take away any authoritative characteristics of religion, then we are left with something more akin to spirituality. That which lacks authority cannot readily be imposed on others, nor is it likely to lead to an abusive relationship between that authority and those under its nominal care.
Hitchens’ rebuttal hinges on the equating of totalitarianism – the system of government that the “evil” secular regimes of Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, Communist North Korea, and the like have imposed on their respective peoples – to theocratic rule. He goes to some length to draw parallels between totalitarian states and theocracies and correctly states that “…the object of perfecting the species – which is the very root and source of the totalitarian impulse – is in essence a religious one.” (p. 232) Hitchens goes on to quote George Orwell, who said that a “totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible.” (p. 232) The impulse towards religion and the sort of self-subjugation that comes from religious belief is the same motivating force that allows totalitarian states to exercise the control and influence they do over their citizenry. These states have not eliminated religion so much as have replaced traditional religious beliefs with new secular ones, in which the state itself becomes a deity worthy of unquestioning admiration, loyalty, and worship. Driving this point home, Hitchens paraphrases from The God That Failed (a work concerning the Russian Communist state), stating that “Communist absolutists did not so much negate religion, in societies that they well understood were saturated with faith and superstition, as seek to replace it.” (p. 246)
Hitchens goes on to note that this supposed counter-argument is a double-edged sword, since it would seem to implicate religion whenever the forces of the state and the forces of faith have become intertwined to the detriment of the general population. He comments at some length on the Catholic Church’s cozy relationship with both Mussolini’s fascist Italy and Hitler’s Nazi Germany, prior to, during, and after World War II. If secularism is to be held accountable for the terrible deeds ostensibly done in its name, then religion should be held accountable when the same deeds are done with faith’s assistance. Secular forces, supposedly guided by rational and humanist principles, are as fallible as any human endeavor can and will be. The advantage for secular forces is that “humanism has many crimes for which to apologize. But it can apologize for them, and also correct them, in its own terms and without having to shake or challenge the basis of any unalterable system of belief.” (p. 250) Religion, which has so often acted as an impediment to human progress on all fronts, is simply less well equipped to deal with these excesses of human nature. Indeed, if Hitchens has demonstrated the validity of his criticisms of religion, it seems ready-made to impose those excesses on humanity to the expense of us all.
He was an Egyptian billionaire, and happened to be the son-in-law of former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. He also served in the Presidential Office under Nasser and was a close aide to Nasser’s successor, Anwar Sadat.On June 27, 2007, at the age of 63, he died mysteriously.“I do not have to prove to anyone that our sources were first-class,” says Zvi Zamir, head of the Mossad in 1973, and the one who met with Marwan on October 5 in London and heard about the date of the war.“In Military Intelligence, they treated him as a double agent without having any proof. We proved that he was not. I hope you will understand the importance of such intelligence at a time when war was expected. Ashraf Marwan was an unparalleled source in our history.”Eli Zeira, who was the head of Military Intelligence during the Yom Kippur War, led the double-agent theory, but it turns out that in the intelligence division, Zeira wasn’t alone in his theory: Maj.-Gen. (res.) Shlomo Gazit believes that Marwan’s contribution was mostly harmful, since the warning he delivered came only hours before the outbreak of the war.“Fifty-five percent [certain that] Marwan was a double agent,” Gazit volunteered. “I did not care about his death, but the phenomenon is important to me. I have a clear opinion – whether he was a real agent or a double agent – that the damage he caused was terrible. If we hadn’t used Marwan, the State of Israel, being led by the IDF, would have prepared for the war a week earlier when news began to arrive about what was happening in Egypt. But they said that if Marwan didn’t tell us about it, it wasn’t serious, it was just an exercise. That doesn’t mean he was a double agent. But the fact is that when you have a super-agent – a super-super-super agent – you are enslaved to him.”In Lugano, Switzerland, I caught up with Dr. Ahron Bregman, who lives in London and teaches at King’s College in the Department of War Studies. Bregman was the man who revealed Marwan’s name in 2002, and he was the Israeli who was closest to the Egyptian spy in his last years, particularly in his last days.Last year Bregman published a book called The Spy who Fell to Earth about his relationship with Marwan.“Double agent? My opinion isn’t any better than yours or Joe Schmo’s,” Bregman says. “But I think the opposite of what Zamir thinks.He has a clear interest in Marwan not being ruled to be a double agent, because what a failure it would be if he were a double agent. When people think about spies, they think it’s like it’s straight out of the Cold War.“In my opinion, Marwan wasn’t like that. What was important to Ashraf was Ashraf. He had a lot of fun in terms of his status when Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin wanted to hear his opinion, or when Zamir met with him.It inflated his ego, and that’s why he loved the game. In the moment of truth, moments before the war, I think he asked himself, ‘Am I an Israeli or an Egyptian?’ He came to the conclusion that he was Egyptian and he misled us. That’s the story of Ashraf Marwan.’”On June 26, 2007, the day before his death, Marwan left Bregman three messages on his answering machine, asking him to call him back. The relationship between the two came about in a strange way: Bregman, who had written several books, became obsessed with discovering the identity of the spy known as “Babylon” or “Angel.”By putting together a puzzle of clues, he was able to arrive at Marwan, who had unbelievable connections. The man was Nasser’s son-in-law, and was very close with the Egyptian leadership.“Eli Zeira did not want to cooperate with me, because after all he had written a book of his own,” says Bregman. “There was a need for verification, and Rami Tal, a very well-known journalist, edited Zeira’s book. Understand what kind of an obsession I had. I flew to Tel Aviv to meet him. I knew he wouldn’t say the name but they probably told him.What was I doing? I was observing from his body language whether Ashraf was the spy. I rehearsed at home in front of the mirror. Nine minutes into the conversation and I decided that I would burst out, randomly: ‘Ashraf Marwan is the spy,’ and then I looked in the direction of his face and ears.At Tel Aviv’s Beit Sokolow, nine minutes on the dot into a casual conversation, I said, ‘Ashraf Marwan is the spy.’ I got my proof.”In the book he did not explicitly write the name but dropped clear and obvious hints. The Egyptian journalists put the pieces together and asked Marwan if he was the man.Marwan denied it, but then a journalist from Al-Ahram met with Bregman in London, where the professor defended his reputation and named the spy.A few days after Bregman’s comments were published in Egypt, it was Marwan on the phone, asking to meet with him.“When I spoke, he immediately felt that I was sorry for what I had done,” Bregman says today. “Marwan was a sick person.You could hear his heavy breathing, and suddenly you feel bad about what you’ve done. I went from being a journalist trying to uncover him, getting a massive scoop, to having to use all my energy to defend myself. We journalists sometimes run after the goal blindly, and as soon as we get it, we come to our senses... I understood that it was stupid. He wasn’t the ‘Angel,’ he was someone who had undergone three heart operations.I said, ‘Whoa, someone’s going to kill him.’” The two agreed to meet at the Intercontinental Hotel, after Bregman rejected the offer of meeting at the Dorchester Hotel, because he remembered that they had tried to assassinate ambassador Shlomo Argov there in 1982, a shot that sparked the first Lebanon War.Bregman took side streets to the hotel, checking constantly that no one was following him.“He was very angry at the Mossad because at the last meeting with them, he discovered that they had recorded him, and as far as he was concerned, they had broken the rules,” he said.“At the meeting we were both crazy. I thought he was going to kill me, and he thought I was recording him. It was a very anxious conversation. He was nervous and I was nervous, but after that, for years, we would talk on the phone just as you and I are talking now. Some of the conversations were informational, and some were for him to pour his heart out and complain, because who could he talk to? His wife didn’t know, he was protecting his children, and, so, there was only Ahron Bregman. He was very well-connected in his life, but as a spy, he was very lonely.”Bregman felt obliged to update Marwan on the dispute that developed during the Yom Kippur War between Zvi Zamir, head of the Mossad, and head of Military Intelligence Eli Zeira.In 2004, Zamir accused Zeira of exposing the identity of Israel’s senior source in Egypt, thus damaging Israel’s ability to recruit agents. In April 2005 Zeira filed a libel suit against Zamir.Retired Judge Theodore Orr was appointed arbitrator, and he decided to accept Zamir’s version. In his decision, the name “Ashraf Marwan” appeared more than once. It was no longer just an Israeli academic who was asserting that Marwan spied for Israel, but now it was the courts that had established the claim as truth. The decision was issued on June 14, 2007, two weeks less a day before Marwan’s death.“The first time I told him that Zeira and Zamir were fighting, and that the case could go to court, he said, ‘It will never get to that point,’” Bregman recalls, “Ashraf didn’t really understand our system, and that’s why when his name was published it stunned him.”Mona, his widow, said that in his final days Marwan had lost 10 kg. as a result of the tension, he would always check whether the door was closed, something he hadn’t done in their 38 years of marriage, and he often complained that he was afraid they were trying to kill him. In an autopsy, they found traces of anti-depressants.On June 26, Marwan left three messages for Bregman on his answering machine. The next day, only a few hundred meters from Piccadilly Circus, at 1:30 p.m., he fell to his death in the rose garden under his fifth-floor apartment in Carlton House Terrace. Pushed or jumped, that’s the question.PROF. URI Bar-Joseph of the School of Political Sciences at the University of Haifa has a theory about the events. In 2010, Bar-Joseph published his book The Angel, which became a film, slated for release next year.“When [president Anwar] Sadat decided to choose [Hosni] Mubarak as his deputy, it really annoyed Marwan, who thought that Mubarak wasn’t very smart,” Bar-Joseph says.“When Sadat was assassinated in 1981 and Mubarak took his place, it was clear to Marwan that he had nothing more to look for in Egypt, and this was despite his and Mubarak’s children being friends.”Mubarak didn’t want to see Marwan near him, certainly not after it was published in Al-Ahram that Marwan was Agent Babylon, or the Angel, Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, the former editor in chief of Al-Ahram, wrote in his last book before he died. At one of the ceremonies marking the anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, he wrote, Mubarak saw Marwan and gave an order to put him on a plane the next day. Mubarak understood that he was a source of embarrassment, especial- ly after the arbitration. This time the espionage was official, and the order to assassinate him was understood, Heikal said.He wrote that he had asked Mubarak several times: “‘Maybe we should investigate whether he worked for the Israelis?’ Mubarak always replied: ‘Forget it.’ He did not want to get involved in the issue; he just wanted to get rid of it.”Bar-Joseph notes that death from falling off a high balcony in London wasn’t a new idea for the Egyptians. Six years prior, on June 21, 2001, it was Egyptian film star Suad Hosny who fell from her balcony at her Stuart Tower residence, and it was also said about her that she was about to write a sensational memoir. In the same tower, in August 1973, Al-Liethy Nassaf, who founded and headed the Republican Guard in the days of Nasser, fell to his death.Coincidence? Marwan’s widow claimed that he had been murdered, blaming the Mossad. Not only that, she also said that his memoir had disappeared from the apartment on the day of his death. But in an email sent by a British detective knowledgeable about the case to an American colleague, it was said that there was no evidence of the book.Bregman remembers how the British detective asked him about the memoir.“I wanted to write a book myself, but Ashraf said, ‘I will write and you will advise.’ Why did he do that? Maybe he was trying to prevent me from writing my book,” Bregman estimates.“We spoke a lot, and I feared that he was trying to trick me. I would surprise him politely, asking ‘What’s the name of the book?’, ‘In which language?’ He said in English, because Arabs don’t read books.”So where’s the book? “The detective asked: ‘Do you have a copy?’ I said no. He asked if I had seen the book, and I replied that I had not. I was very embarrassed when I began to suspect that there was no book, because I told everyone that there was. I began to investigate.I called every library you could think of to ask if Ashraf Marwan had visited, and finally a librarian called Mary, a deputy chief librarian in Washington at the National Archives, said Marwan had visited them twice, and she even gave me dates. She said he came with a cane, limped and said he was writing his memoirs. The second time he arrived, he brought her Godiva chocolate as a gift. I sent a letter to the English detective and said, ‘Here’s the proof.’ If there ever was a book? I hope so, otherwise Ashraf pulled the wool over my eyes.”Bregman came to court at the family’s request. It was important for them to determine that death was murder, since suicide was considered an embarrassment in Islam, especially for such a distinguished family.“I went to court and reinforced the murder theory,” Bregman relates, “I told him that he had reasons to stay alive. He planned to meet me. He had a book he wanted to publish, and there was apparently something in the book that caused him to be murdered. If you ask me what I think? Forty=-nine percent he was thrown, 51% he committed suicide. He didn’t want them to think he jumped, he wanted them to think he was murdered and that’s why he used me. He had planned the story after his death. He called me the day before to leave a testimony, recording himself on the answering machine.He knew that I would save the messages. He knew me well.Of course I saved them. He knew I would tell the world that we had talked, that I would tell them that there was a book.Maybe it sounded a bit fanciful, but if you knew the man, you would understand that it makes perfect sense.”No one knows exactly what happened in central London on June 27, 2007, but if there are those who can back up any theory, they are the eyewitnesses to Marwan’s death. There were four – by coincidence or not – who happened to be working in one of his companies. The four sat for a business meeting and waited for Marwan to join them. They even called and heard that he was running a bit late. Suddenly one of them saw him fall to his death.Another coincidence?Ashraf Marwan was buried as a hero in Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak said he was an Egyptian patriot, not even mentioning the suspicion that the man had betrayed his country.“They gave him a hero’s funeral because they did not want to hurt the significance and importance of the Egyptian aristocracy,” Zamir says. “To say he was a spy would cast a heavy shadow on the group that is considered elite.“We didn’t protect him. The proof is that the intelligence sources and the IDF, even with our pleas, let Eli Zeira and his companions express themselves rudely and make Marwan persona non grata. There, I said more than I’m willing to say.”Gazit doesn’t give too much thought to Marwan’s death.“I have no idea what happened. I was not aware, involved or connected. A client who led an adventurous lifestyle like he did shouldn’t be surprised if someone wants to kill him.”It seems that the mystery of Ashraf Marwan’s life will remain unsolved, even after the 20th anniversary of his death, but that does not mean that his exciting story won’t be in the news anymore.“I do not know a case in history, at least in the 20th century, of a spy who gave such critical information in such a critical period that had a significant impact on the way things turned out,” Bar-Joseph is convinced.“The only one in the same league is Richard Sorge, not because he gave incredible information that the Germans were going to attack the Soviet Union in June 1941, but because he gave information about the Japanese not going to attack the Soviet Union at the end of the year, enabling Stalin to take his forces from the Siberian front and bring them to defend Moscow.If Marwan hadn’t given the warning of the war, I think that the Golan Heights would have fallen to the Syrians on the second day of fighting, because there was no one there to defend them.”So Bregman remains with questions.“No one has said, ‘Okay, he was a double agent,’ and no one said: ‘They threw him from the window and he didn’t commit suicide.’ It would have been the crowning moment of my career had it not been for the tragedy. You don’t want on your conscience the thought that you made someone jump, or that you got him killed. You just say,’ It’s not good what happened.’”Translated by Benjamin Glatt.

As Apple CEO Tim Cook continues to make his rounds in Europe, Good Morning Britain managed to catch him for a quick interview while he was visiting Woodberry Down Primary School yesterday. Regarding fake news, which has been an increasingly hot topic since the U.S. Presidential election got into full swing last year, Cook said that "this is one of today's chief problems."In the wake of growing fake news, companies like Facebook have taken action to bring the quality of an article to their users' attention before they share it with their friends. For Apple, Cook said that the solution to the problem is not a simple one.Cook covered another topic during his stay in London this week, discussing Brexit with United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May. According to The Independent , in the talk Cook said that he is "very optimistic" about the UK's future outside of the European Union, and that it will be "just fine," although there will undoubtedly be some "bumps in the road along the way."Apple will continue to back the UK in the future, as it currently plans on building a new headquarters at London's Battersea Power Station , expected to be complete by 2021. After its completion, 1,400 employees will be moved from eight locations around London to occupy the company's new UK offices.Early this morning, Cook also continued documenting his European adventures on Twitter, congratulating the Tate Britain art gallery after he visited its digital artwork exhibit. Yesterday, he stopped in the offices of ustwo games in London to get a sneak peak at the latest mobile game from the company behind Monument Valley.Development Manitoba Museum Announces $160-Million Expansion Plan
I knew about Dennett’s beliefs since, in fact, we had once had a brief discussion about dogs' memory capacity and the nature of canine consciousness when he had visited my university to give a series of lectures. His beliefs about this matter puzzled me, even in light of only casual observation of dog behaviors. For example, many dog owners have a variety of "Find the object" phrases that they use and to which the dog responds appropriately. For example my dogs respond to, "Where's your ball?" by dashing around to find the ball and then bringing it to me. If it is inaccessible, they will usually stand near where they believe it to be and bark. My dogs also respond to "Where's Joannie?" which is a convenient phrase which helps me to locate my wife. On hearing it the dog goes to the room where they last saw my wife. If she is upstairs on in the basement, the dog will move the appropriate set of stairs and wait there. If she is out of the house the dog will usually go to the door that she used when she left. If the dog doesn't know where she is, or if she has moved since he last saw her, he will usually start to search for Joan. Each of these is an instance of episodic memory since the dog must remember where he last saw the item. This memory clearly has the required “when,” “what,” and “where” components, since we are asking for a location of a particular object when it was most recently seen based upon the dog's personal experience.

"The tramp is dead, long live the tramp," cries Kishore Bhawsar, a 52-year-old bus conductor and fan club member who has composed a paean to his favourite actor. Mr Bhawsar says his life changed after watching The Gold Rush, the 1925 comic gem featuring Chaplin chasing fortunes in the icy wilderness of Alaska. "Chaplin absorbs grief and makes you laugh. He said, 'I walk in the rain to hide my tears.' He was a poet," Mr Bhawsar shouts above the din. The gathering roars in approval, as the procession snakes through the town while bystanders gape and traffic comes to a halt. As dusk settles over the town, festivities move to a crummy hall where locals perform mimes, skits and watch a Chaplin film on the big screen. "It's a day we wait for every year. It's our biggest festival in many senses," says Arjunji Bhimji Fariya, a 70-something Morgan Freeman lookalike and retired bus driver. Unusual place Mr Fariya saw his first Chaplin silent short as a 12-year-old in Karachi, Pakistan, where he was born. Now he is one of the oldest members of Charlie Circle. "I have been walking in the Chaplin procession for the last eight years," he says with a hint of pride. Ashok Aswani launched the club after watching Chaplin films
Adipur, in arid, sprawling Kutch region, is an unlikely place for Chaplin adulation to grow deep roots. Not very long ago, it was a sleepy town of refugees from Sindh in Pakistan, better known for a urea factory and a thriving port in its neighbourhood. Two cinemas - one quaintly named Oslo after a Norwegian who visited the town - showed mainly Bollywood films. But one man's serendipitous discovery of Chaplin led to the town's obsession with the actor. Back in the summer of 1966, The Gold Rush, thanks to a quirk of cinema distribution, arrived at Oslo and changed the life of Ashok Aswani, the son of a local pharmacist. A drama and cinema buff - early pictures show him as a rakish young man, dressed sharply with an oil-slicked bouffant - Mr Aswani was cycling to his work as a typist when he saw a poster for the film. He screeched to a halt. "I was wonderstruck. I found his dress and look fascinating. How does the man bend his legs like that?" he reminisces, bleary-eyed. He says he got off his bike and gaped at the poster for 10 minutes. Then he forgot about his job, left his cycle outside the hall, bought a ticket and went in. "A whole new world of cinema opened up for me. The music, technique, photography was so different! And I thought, is Chaplin an actor or a magician? I fell off my seat laughing in the darkness," says Mr Aswani. 'Obsession' That day, Mr Aswani watched all four showings of The Gold Rush. He was also fired. The procession is a major festival in the town
"I lost my job, but I gained Chaplin. I became obsessed with him, I became interested in acting and wanted desperately to become an actor," he remembers. The young man, his life changed by Chaplin's cinema, dropped out of college and applied for an actor's course in India's most famous cinema school in the western city of Pune. He passed the admission test, joined the school but was thrown out after six months when he failed his tests. Returning to Adipur, Mr Aswani opened the Charlie Circle club in 1973. He became a practitioner of indigenous medicine, giving away free Chaplin CDs with his potions. Chaplin's spirit Over a quarter of a century, the Chaplin fan club has grown (more than 200 members and rising). It has inspired a 74-minute documentary by Australian filmmaker Kathryn Millard, a website and TV offers to participate in reality shows. "When I set out to research a documentary about Chaplin imitators around the world, I had no idea that I would meet a very special community - perhaps Chaplin's most devoted followers - in a small town in India," says Ms Millard. She says whenever she shows the film, people ask her whether there is a way they could join the Charlie Circle: "I hope they may start accepting associate members from other countries!" Chaplin impersonators are to be found all over the world, but it appears his spirit is truly alive and well in Adipur. "The celebrations will never cease," says 60-year-old Mr Aswani, as the party winds down and he shakes off his tramp suit. "Our children and grandchildren are already hooked to Chaplin's films, so our homage to the actor will never end."
General Methods Participants Patients with bilateral parietal lobe damage are extremely rare. The survival rate after suffering the type of cerebrovascular event that produces bilateral parietal lobe damage is low. We were able to identify to patients with bilateral parietal lobe damage in our database. These patients have been discussed previously (Berryhill, Phuong, Picasso, Cabeza, & Olson, 2007); we summarize their profiles here. Patient EE555 is a 39-year-old former teacher with 16 years of education. Between April and June 2004, she suffered three infarcts in the watershed between the posterior and middle cerebral arteries. EE555’s MRI revealed symmetrical lesions in lateral aspects of the inferior parietal lobe, extending from superior aspects of the occipital lobe through the angular gyrus (Brodmann areas (BA) 39) in and around inferior and middle portions of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Damage did not encroach into the midline (e.g. precuneus). EE555’s lesions are depicted in . Open in a separate window EE555’s physical and perceptual symptoms are currently stable. Patient EE555’s primary deficit is simultanagnosia as defined by her inability to apprehend the contents of a visual scene, her abnormal performance on line cancellation tasks, in which she crosses off items only at the center, and her tendency towards local bias, as illustrated by her report of the local but not global elements in Navon letters. Language comprehension and speech fluency are unimpaired as assessed by her conversational skills, and performance on the auditory tests of the Western Aphasia Battery (Kertesz, 1982), which were uniformly at ceiling. Reading and writing are impaired due to her simultanagnosia and spatial disorientation. Her visual acuity is normal. EE555 was tested 1.5 – 2.5 years post insult. Patient TQ591 is a 49-year-old former preschool teacher with 15 years of education. She suffered bilateral parieto-occipital damage due to CNS cerebral vasculitis in March 2006. TQ591’s MRI revealed signs of previous subacute posterior cerebral artery infarctions. The primary lesions are in bilateral parietal regions; see . The left parietal lesion extends into IPS (BA 39) and precuneus (BA 7). There are two right lesion sites: the inferior lesion is in superior aspects of the occipital lobe (BA 18 and 19), and the superior lesion is in the superior parietal lobe (BA 7). In both hemispheres, the lesions extend slightly into temporo-occipital (BA 19) regions and parietal white matter. TQ591’s cortical damage is now considered stable. TQ591’s primary deficit is simultanagnosia, similar to that described for patient EE555. Language comprehension and speech fluency are unimpaired as assessed by her conversational skills, ability to follow instructions and comply with requests, and performance on the Western Aphasia Exam (Kertesz, 1982). Reading and writing are somewhat impaired due to her simultanagnosia and spatial disorientation (she loses her place on a page). Her eyesight is corrected-to-normal. TQ591 was tested 6 – 12 months post insult. Standardized Test Performance The subtests of the Wechsler memory scale (WMS-III, Wechsler, 1997b) that do not require comparing complex visual elements were conducted and index scores calculated for the following measures: auditory immediate, auditory delayed, auditory recognition delayed and working memory (see for standardized test performance). Patient EE555 performed at least one standard deviation below the mean across all measures. TQ591’s performance was more than one standard deviation below the mean on the auditory immediate and working memory indices but normal on the auditory delayed and auditory recognition delayed tests. These findings provide an initial indication that posterior parietal lobe damage may slightly impair memory performance. Table 2 Test Subtest EE555 TQ591 WMS-III Immediate 86 80 Delayed 77 97 WM 83 79 Recog delayed 55 110 Forward Span 6 8 Backward 4 4 Span CVLT-II Immediate free recall, trial 5 −2.5 −.5 Short delay free recall −1.5 −1.5 Long delay free recall −3.0 0 Long delay −5.0 −.5 yes-no recog hits Total .5 −.5 Intrusions Forced-choice 100% 100% Open in a separate window The California Verbal Learning Test-II (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000) is a measure of an adult’s ability to learn and remember verbal material, such as word lists. The CVLT-II data provides additional insight into verbal short-term and long-term memory. Patient EE555’s performance on the CVLT-II indicates that she has impaired verbal memory at both short and long delays. She is most impaired on measures of delayed recognition. In contrast, Patient TQ591’s performance on the CVLT-II indicates that she has spared immediate free recall for verbal information, but moderately impaired verbal free recall memory at short delays. At long delays, her free recall and recognition memory is normal. In both patients, forward and backward digit span was normal. It should be noted that digit span measure is known to be well-preserved in diverse lesion populations, including amnesics (Black, 1986). Control Participants Twelve normal control subjects participated in each experiment (Experiment 1a: Mean (M) age = 42.5, M years of education (edu) = 14.6, 4 males; Experiment 1b: M age = 45.0, M edu = 14.8, 6 males; Experiment 2a: M age = 47.3, M edu = 13.9, 6 males; Experiment 2b: M age = 39.7, M edu = 15.4, 7 males; Experiment 3: M age = 47.3, M edu = 14.1, 7 males). Stimuli Three stimulus categories were used in Experiment 1a–2b: colors, abstract shapes and common objects. The color category consisted of 20 circular color patches selected from the full color spectrum. The shape category consisted of 36 black, bilaterally symmetrical abstract shapes generated by a computer algorithm that has been previously employed in studies of visual WM (Jiang et al., 2000). The common objects or ‘tool’ category consisted of 36 grayscale photographs and was limited to the subordinate category of tools in order to be consistent with the other stimulus categories. Stimuli measured approximately 6 cm by 6 cm and were presented on a white background. In Experiment 3, colorized line drawings of common objects were used (Rossion & Pourtois, 2004). To accommodate the simultanagnosia in both patients and the fact parietal damage slows visual processing (Peers et al., 2005), all stimuli in all experiments were presented sequentially at the center of the monitor at the rate of 1000 ms/item. Perceptual Control Tasks To insure that EE555 and TQ591could accurately perceive the stimuli that were used in the WM tasks, two perceptual control tasks were administered. (1) Perception of tools. Thirty-six grayscale photographs of household tools were presented on a white background using ePrime software (Psychology Software Tools). The task was to verbally label each tool under free viewing conditions. The experimenter recorded the responses. EE555 was able to identify 89% of the tools. TQ591 identified 72% of the tools. Errors for both subjects were for low-frequency items: clamps, a leather punch, a wood plane, an eggbeater, and a whisk. (2) Perception of colors and abstract shapes. Multicolored geometric shapes were printed on cards. There were eight different shapes and eight different colors creating a set of 24 cards. The task was to match a particular card based on color, shape, or color-shape. Both subjects were accurate when asked to match colors (100%), shapes (100%) or color/shape conjunctions (100%). Analysis In the recall experiments, Experiments 1a and 2a, the dependent measure is raw accuracy. In Experiment 1a, chance performance was .25. In Experiment 2a, chance performance was nearly 0. In the recognition experiments, Experiments 1b, 2b and 3, the dependent measure is corrected recognition (CR). CR is equal to the hit rate (responding “yes” on a match trial) minus the false alarm rate (responding “yes” on a non-match trial). Chance performance corresponds to a CR value of 0. Trials were excluded if no response was registered within two standard deviations of the mean reaction time (Excluded trials: controls 2.9%, patients 3.3%). Data was analyzed with non-parametric permutation analyses approximating independent sample t-test (Experiment 2a, 3) and a repeated measures analysis of variance (Experiments 1ab, 2b). Permutation tests are an alternative to parametric tests for cases of small numbers of participants and can be accurately used for sample sizes larger than one. For the repeated-measures ANOVA tests, a permutation test was used in which we first computed the F statistic under the standard mixed two-factor ANOVA model. Then the observed values were randomly permuted across the patient and control subjects. The F statistics were recomputed for the permuted data set and a one-tailed count over 1000 replicates was used to compute the significance values (Legendre, Oden, Sokal, Vaudor, & Kim, 1990; Manly, 1997). For the t-test version, no t-value is calculated. In the first stage of analysis, the null hypothesis (that there is no difference between the patient and control groups) is tested using a t-test (Experiment 3). During the second stage, two groups were randomly defined and subjected to the same comparison. This continues until 1000 random samples are taken. The reported p-values refer to the proportion of scores below the observed experimental value (Good, 1994). Statistical analyses were conducted using Matlab (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to perform paired t-tests and one-sample t-tests for the comparison of recall and recognition task performance.
Methods Task Prior to the onset of the actual experiment, all subjects performed several practice trials to become familiar with the trial design. Each trial began with a central fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the sequential presentation, in the center of the screen, of four randomly selected stimuli (1000 ms/item) from one stimulus category (color, shape, tool) at the center of the monitor. Items appeared contiguously with no inter-stimulus interval. After a 1000 ms masked delay interval, a probe stimulus was presented at central fixation until a response was made, (see ). The task was to report the temporal position the probe item had occupied during the memory sequence (position 1, 2, 3, or 4). Responses were unspeeded in this and all subsequent experiments. Each position was equally likely to be probed, making chance performance equal to 25% correct. After the response was entered, the next trial was initiated by pressing the space bar. There were 20 trials per stimulus category. Open in a separate window Note that although it is common to use concurrent verbal memory loads to minimize the possibility that visual items are remembered by verbal labels (Luck & Vogel, 1997; Olson & Jiang, 2002) this type of task is difficult to implement in older and patient populations and introduces additional variables that may confound the effects of interest. Each stimulus category varied in the degree to which verbal encoding could reasonably be used, from a high level in the tool category, an intermediate level in the color category, and none in the shape category.
Results and Discussion Because this experiment employed a recall task in which false alarms were not possible, the dependent measure was raw accuracy. The accuracy values for each group (control, patient) and temporal position (1, 2, 3, 4) were subjected to permutation analyses (see ), collapsing across stimulus category. The groups did not differ (F 1, 12 = 62.17, p = .10, M patients = .64, M controls = .69). The main effect of temporal position was significant (F 3, 36 = 5.67, p = .002) although no pairwise comparisons reached significance, performance was best when the probe item appeared at the 4th temporal position (p = .07). The interaction of group and temporal position reached significance (F 3, 36 = 3.06, p = .05) as the patient group showed a stronger primacy effect than did the control subjects. To determine if there were accuracy differences for different stimulus types, the data were collapsed across temporal position and a permutation analysis examined group (control, patient) and stimulus category (color, shape, tool). Again, the groups did not differ (F 1, 12 = 9.65, p = .86). There was a main effect of stimulus category (F 2, 24 = 8.92, p = .001), such that performance on the tool category was better than performance with shape stimuli (p = .04). The interaction of group and stimulus category failed to reach significance however (F 2, 24 = 1.86, p = .23), see . Open in a separate window Finally, the errors were examined in order to evaluate differences between the patient and control groups. Both groups erroneously chose temporal neighbors of the correct answer (i.e. responded ‘3rd’ when the answer was actually ‘2nd’) more often than temporally distant non-neighbor (M neighbor errors: patients: .61; controls: .64). The patients showed particularly strong recency and primacy effects as demonstrated by the lower proportion of errors when the correct answer was in the first or last position (M patients: .29; M controls: .45) than when it was embedded at the second and third positions. These results suggest that the patients’ performance was unimpaired in a visual order WM task when recall was probed.
Results and Discussion The corrected recognition scores for each group were subjected to permutation analyses (see ). Unlike the findings of Experiment 1a, the patients were impaired relative to controls (F 1, 12 = 744.62, p = .03; M patients = .34, M controls = .75). The main effect of stimulus category also reached significance (F 2, 24 = 4.46, p = .03), this was due to overall better performance on the tool stimuli than shapes (p = .04). The interaction of group × stimulus category did not reach significance (F 2, 24 = 1.03, p = .40). When performance was assessed as a function of the number of changes in the presented order (either 0, 2, 3, or 4), it was found that patients were worse at detecting changes (F 1, 12 = 996.84, p < .001) and that their performance did not steadily improve as the number of changes increased (M 0 changes = .75, M 2 changes = .54, M 3 changes = .42, M 4 changes = .65). In contrast, more changes improved control subjects’ performance (M 0 = .85, M 2 = .77, M 3 = .96, M 4 = .92). The interaction of group and number of changes did not reach significance (F 3, 36 = 2.14, p = .15). These results show that the patients’ performance was impaired in an order recognition task. This finding provides preliminary evidence that PPC lesions may differentially affect recall as compared to recognition.
Results and Discussion The corrected recognition scores for each group (control, patient) and stimulus category (color, shape, tool) were subjected to permutation analyses (see ). The patient group was significantly impaired relative to the control group (F 1, 12 = 637.51, p = .01, M patients = .40, M controls = .65). There was also a main effect of stimulus category (F 2, 24 = 32.43, p < .001) such that performance on the tool stimuli was better than color (p = .003) and shape (p = .001) performance. It should be noted that for the color stimuli, but not for the tool or shape stimuli, patient EE555’s performance drove the group effect (see ). There was no interaction of group × stimulus category (F 2, 24 < 1, n.s.). This was confirmed by evaluation of the difference scores between the control and patient groups, which differed by a constant value across stimulus categories. In order to make this experiment directly comparable to Experiment 2a, only the performance in the tool category are shown in . A permutation analysis of only the tool data revealed a significant effect of group (p = .02, M patients = .59, M controls = .84). The pattern of performance was identical across stimulus types.

Overall performance was highest in the tool condition and lowest in the novel shape condition. However, deficits were observed to a similar degree for all three stimulus types, suggesting that the WM deficit exists when a verbal strategy could be employed for nameable items, such as tools, and even when such a strategy would be challenging, such as with the novel shape stimuli.
First, Emmanuelle dreams of going to some big castle, and settles into her room. Raymond (Reginald Chevalier) and Cara (Debra K. Beatty) are already there when she arrives, and then Pierre (Brad Nick’ell) and Tascha (Tiendra Demian) show up. Then two other female crewmembers, Jay (Lori Morrissey) and Gee (Holly Hollywood aka Stacey Mobley), arrive. And when Emmanuelle hears a noise in the room next to hers, she looks in and sees Theo (Timothy Di Pri) and a woman (I dind’t catch her character’s name) naked on the bed. Later that night she looks out her window and see Raymond and Cara having sex in an outdoor hot tub. That’s our first full sex scene of the disc, about 9 minutes into it, and it’s pretty hot (again notable for being an interracial sex scene, which is rare in softcore), and also give the real Raymond and Cara some idea up on the ship. In a flashback we get a replay of a sex scene from A Lesson In Love where Emmanuelle had sex in a dark room with a man (Carl Ferro), but we can’t see much. Then Emmanuelle takes a shower, and we’re treated to lingering close-ups of Krista’s nude body. Meanwhile, Emmanuelle has a crystal ball that she found somewhere, and while she’s in the shower a male genie (Andre Lemay) appears out of it. He introduces himself to Emmanuelle, and she names him Gene.
Later, Gene tells Emmanuelle of his very first “master” centuries ago in the Middle East. A man named Kareem who has a harem filled with multiple wives, the youngest and one who loves him the most is Zanzi (played by Krista). All he seems to do is lay around in his fancy tent while his other wives (played by the various women who are from the alien crew) massage him or some of them do a sexy dance for him and strip. There are 3 different scenes, including one in a bath, where he is in bed with all of the other wives at once. For some reason, we’re lead to believe that Zanzi in considered the ugly duckling of the wives (which is hard to believe when you see Krista in her cleavage-bearing outfit), the wives make fun of her and Kareem under-appreciates her. We get a scene where one of the wives (I don’t know which actress it is) gets naked an masturbates while Tasha secretly watches her. That’s where Gene reveals himself to her and offers to grant her deepest wish, which is to be to have Kareem to himself. When Zanzi tries to join in with Kareem and the other wives, she gets frustrated and wishes that all the other wives would go away and tries to have sex with Kareem one on one, but he’s not satisfied being with just one woman, so it doesn’t go well.
Mike Novogratz, a former macro hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, said in a Reuters Investment Summit this month that mainstream institutional investors were about six to eight months from adopting bitcoin.The very moral fabric in which we have made progress when it comes to race relations in America... He’s failed us. And it’s very unfortunate that our president would say things like he did in that press conference yesterday when he says, “tthere are good people on the side of the Nazis. They weren’t all Nazis and they weren’t all white supremacists.” Mr. President, good people don’t pal around with Nazis and white supremacists. Maybe they don’t consider themselves white supremacists and Nazis; certainly they hold those views. This has become very troubling. And for anyone to come on any network and defend what President Trump did and said at that press conference yesterday is completely lost and the potential to be morally bankrupt. I’m sorry, no, I believe that and I’m being very honest as one who has been talking about these issues for a very long time. I’m sorry that this is where we are right now. I hope the president learns a lesson from his press conference on yesterday. It’s disturbing.

The Hobby Lobby case pits the religious freedom of a business that employs 13,000 people against the rights of its female workers to comprehensive preventive care. The idea that such care should include coverage for birth control comes first from Congress, which mandated preventive coverage when it passed the Affordable Care Act. And it comes from the Institute of Medicine, which has plenty of research to cite showing the health benefits of averting unintended pregnancy. The first question about this case is whether a business has religious rights—in lawyer’s terms, is it a “person” within the meaning of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act? I would say no, and more about why in a minute. But even if the Supreme Court mistakenly recognizes Hobby Lobby’s claim to religious freedom (the company is privately rather than publicly owned, which could make the difference), here’s the remaining key question, posed by Justice Anthony Kennedy at argument. As Kennedy pointed out, Hobby Lobby’s view that it need not cover birth control would allow “the employer to put the employee in a disadvantageous position. The employee may not agree with these religious beliefs of the employer.” Kennedy then asked: Do “the religious beliefs just trump?”
For a few days in the first week of September I was in the Breton port city of Brest (which although medieval is an architectural riot of modernity, nearly every building except its impregnable chateau having been levelled in 1944) at an academic colloquium on Mapping Humanity and the Post-human to which I'd been invited by its organiser, the erudite and vivacious Hélène Machinal . Its programme was wide-ranging , and mostly in French. Although I couldn't follow everything that was said, I think I got the gist of most, and was kindly helped by a student who volunteered to sit beside me and pass notes.I found it strange to be listening in to serious academic discussion of ideas that originated on the fringes of science fiction, and to hear 'Kurzweil', 'Vinge' and 'extropians' pop up from a flow of French discourse like yellow plastic ducks on the Seine. About half the discussion was on the post-human in mainstream literature and philosophy, but popular culture, movies, and SF were just as minutely and seriously anatomised.My own presentation touched on my earliest encounter with extropianism and (that cheap laugh out of the way) argued that Darwin had made post-humanism possible: first, by establishing that humanitya species with predecessors and (by implication) possible successors, and (therefore) that the human mind was the outcome of a material process; and secondly, by shifting the notion of 'species' from an essence to a population, with no intrinsic limit of variation. Once 'the human' ceases to be an essence, it loses its self-evident status as a standard of value. Watson and Crick followed up in 1953 by demonstrating the material basis of heredity, and hence the possibility of consciously changing it.Two developments that were new in the 1980s and 1990s made post-humanism a project rather than a prophecy. The first was that thanks to Moore's Law and molecular biology, it became possible for the first time for people to imagine thatmight live into the post-human era. The second was that socialism, the global project whereby the International was to unite the human race, was over, and with it the counter-project of liberal humanism. Humanity is no longer an imagined community. If it's ever to become so again, something like the socialist project will have to be revived, or replaced by a different project with less hubris but no less ambition.Otherwise the robots will rise up and eat our brains, if we haven't beaten them to it by bashing each other's heads in first.

Here’s what I’ve learned so far about what you can and can’t do with this additional storage:Growing up in a Recession Individuals who grow up during recessions tend to form life-long beliefs, including that success in life depends more on luck than on effort. In Growing up in a Recession: Beliefs and the Macroeconomy (NBER Working Paper No. 15321), co-authors Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo substantiate the importance of the historical economic environment in shaping economic attitudes, affecting individuals' views of the role of government, and influencing whether those beliefs change later in life. One of the key findings of their study is that individuals who grow up during recessions tend to form life-long beliefs, including that success in life depends more on luck than on effort. Individuals who grow up during recessions also tend to support more government redistribution, but they have less confidence in public institutions. On the whole, the authors find, orientations formed during difficult economic times can help to determine the economic system, institutional outcomes, and the role of the government across countries, although this study focused on the United States. One of the strongest results from this research is the long-lasting effect of recessions on individuals' confidence in government and its role in society. For example, individuals have a significantly lower level of confidence in Congress and the executive branch of the federal government when they experience poor economic conditions while they are coming of age. But there are off-setting tendencies, too. "On the one hand, recession-hit individuals believe that the government should intervene more, so they lean more to the left. On the other hand, these individuals distrust institutions, believing them to be ineffective, therefore leaning more to the right." And, while recessions substantially decrease the confidence in government institutions, they do not appear to have an effect on the individual's level of generalized trust -- that is, his or her trust in others or other sectors of society. The authors also report that individuals' propensity to distrust government institutions after macroeconomic shocks occur is highest when they are between the ages of 18 and 25. Although also possible between age 25 until roughly age 40, after that age people tend not to change their beliefs in response to negative economic shocks. This research is based on data culled from self-reported individual answers collected by the General Social Survey (GSS) regarding individuals socioeconomic beliefs. The GSS conducts basic scientific research on the structure and development of American society using a standard set of behavioral and attitudinal questions, many of which have remained unchanged since 1972. The researchers focus on the 18-to-25 age group who came of age in a recession. This age focus is based on social psychologists' findings that these are among the most impressionable years, during which time one's beliefs and values about how society and the economy work are formed. Guiliano and Spilimbergo match each generation's responses to yearly economic events, nationally and regionally, and refine them to include other economic factors such as volatility, booms, and regional GDP growth. The GSS data also contain background information on each individual, including religion, family income, parents education, and location when the individual was 16, which the authors incorporate into their analysis of the respondents' answers in the survey. -- Frank Byrt The Digest is not copyrighted and may be reproduced freely with appropriate attribution of source.Previous Next
Global carbon emissions are on the rise again in 2017 after three years of little-to-no growth, according to researchers at the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project.It was previously hoped that emissions might soon reach their peak after three stable years, so the new projection for 2017 is an unwelcome message for policy makers and delegates at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23) in Bonn this week.The research, published today simultaneously in the journals, Earth System Science Data Discussions and Environmental Research Letters, reveals that global emissions from all human activities will reach 41 billion tonnes in 2017, following a projected 2% rise in burning fossil fuels.The figures point to China as the main cause of the renewed growth in fossil emissions - with a projected growth of 3.5%.COemissions are expected to decline by 0.4% in the US and 0.2% in the EU, smaller declines than during the previous decade.Increases in coal use in China and the US are expected this year, reversing their decreases since 2013.Lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Quéré, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at UEA, said: "Global COemissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three year stable period. This is very disappointing."With global COemissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2ºC let alone 1.5ºC."This year we have seen how climate change can amplify the impacts of hurricanes with more intense rainfall, higher sea levels and warmer ocean conditions favouring more powerful storms. This is a window into the future. We need to reach a peak in global emissions in the next few years and drive emissions down rapidly afterwards to address climate change and limit its impacts."Key findings:Dr Glen Peters of the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who led one of the studies said: "The return to growth in global emissions in 2017 is largely due to growth in Chinese emissions, projected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 after two years with declining emissions. The use of coal, the main fuel source in China, may rise by 3% due to stronger growth in industrial production and lower hydro-power generation due to less rainfall.""The growth in 2017 emissions is unwelcome news, but it is too early to say whether it is a one-off event on a way to a global peak in emissions, or the start of a new period with upward pressure on global emissions growth."The team flags that persistent uncertainties exist in our ability to estimate recent changes in emissions, particularly when there are unexpected changes as in the last few years."Even though we may detect a change in emission trend early, it may take as much as 10 years to confidently and independently verify a sustained change in emissions using measurements of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide," said Dr Peters."Policy makers in Bonn are preparing for the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement, that will start in 2018 and occur every five years, and this puts immense pressure on the scientific community to develop methods and perform measurements that can truly verify changes in emissions within this five-yearly cycle," said Prof Le Quéré.University of East AngliaA vicious underground social media war is rocking a City Council race in the Brooklyn ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Boro Park — and the nastiest blows are in Yiddish.
My wife calls it PRS (pre-race stress), but I do tend to get a little too obsessive before a race. I have a Nathan 20oz hand-held, an Amphipod waist and an SJ Ultra Vest and the choice of what I carry really depends on the elevation profile, location of the aid stations and the weather on the day of the race. Lately, I’ve become very picky about going as light as I can and getting away with it. If I’m running a marathon organized by Inside Trail Racing, for example, I don’t have to carry any Clif Shot Gels or Succeed S Caps, since I know they have ’em at the aid station. I also take the time to make a cheat sheet, a hand-drawn map of aid-stations overlaid on the elevation profile to break the run into shorter segments. I visualize a fair bit and mentally map the climbs to other familiar runs (though this strategy didn’t quite work at the Berkeley Trail Adventure 50K). I know I’m only racing the course and myself, but running a marathon is a personal challenge, to see if I can learn something about myself and to improve a little. And lastly, almost without fail, I write a race report immediately after, trying to remember as much detail as I possibly can. It’s the post-mortem, to assess what, if any, went wrong, lessons learned and things to improve for a subsequent race.

Business tickerNEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel prices have risen to their highest in three years in some cities in the country, following a sharp rise in international rates driven by the hurricane-induced shutdown of refining capacity in the US.Petrol price in Mumbai rose to its highest since August 2014 while diesel prices reached their peak since August 2014 in Kolkata and Chennai. In Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, petrol prices are at their peak since January this year. Since July 1, petrol has climbed Rs 5.18 per litre in Mumbai, and diesel by Rs 5.75 per litre in Kolkata, and Rs 5.71per litre in Chennai.On Tuesday, petrol cost Rs 79.48 per litre in Mumbai and Rs 70.38 per litre in Delhi while diesel was priced at Rs 62.37 per litre in Mumbai and Rs 58.72 per litre in Delhi. Prices vary according to local levies imposed by different states. Petrol and diesel aren't in the ambit of the goods and services tax and the rate of taxes imposed by states vary.Indian fuel retailers such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum started daily revision of prices of petrol and diesel from the middle of June, replacing the previous practice of fortnightly revision. Companies align local fuel prices with international rates and account for currency fluctuations in daily revision.Daily price changes are small and rarely make it to the headlines and go largely unnoticed. The recent price spike is expected to result in enormous gains for oil companies who while charging higher fuel prices also benefitted from lower crude rates as refinery shutdown in US cut demand for crude oilLast week, I posted this article analyzing NFL team/college pairings in the NFL Draft. In that study, I included every draft pick since 1936, as the goal was to get a flavor of NFL history. However, I thought it would be fun to do the same thing but to look at more recent time periods. Today’s post will be mostly tables, so hopefully you guys can add the analysis. Let’s start by looking at all (but only) the drafts in the post-merger period in NFL history.

We’re da best. Think diffrent do ya? Come and have a go then, ya runty little wimp!Crews are working to clear fallen trees and downed power lines in the city and suburbs after heavy storms swept through the area. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down in Lake County. funnel cloud was spotted around 9 p.m. Sunday in Grayslake. NWS said a preliminary survey finds that the EF-1 tornado was on the ground for 7.5 miles. The tornado's track began in Round Lake, continued through Hainesville and Grayslake, and ended in Wildwood. Winds of between 90 to 100 mph were recorded. The maximum width of the tornado's track was around 300 yards.This was the first tornado to hit Lake County since 2002."All of a sudden whish, whish. Then everybody hit the floor," Johnny Scott said.Several roofs were damaged, including that of Grayslake Central High School, where the dugout was blown across the street and field equipment was tossed around. Part of the school's roof landed in the choir teacher's front yard."As you can see, our wonderful tree caught it," Jenny White said. "So I want to keep this tree. I love this tree. I hope we can save it. It saved us."No one was injured in Grayslake, but there was property damage."Everybody was concerned that the tree would fall into the house. But God was merciful, and you saw all the branches that did break," Loretha Scott said. Next door, Jeffrey Goldsmith's vehicles were damaged."Three or four vehicles were dented and wiped out a bunch of trees torn off, thrown over here," Goldsmith said. "It's just terrible."Stuff was flying in the air. A car was very shaken, very badly, trying to hold on to that thing. Barricades from construction were flying in the air. And no sooner had it started than it stopped," Sgt. Scott Heimus, Grayslake Police Department, said."By the time everything was over, I came out, and the tree that was two feet from the sunroom was totally uprooted," Theresa Talbert, resident, said.The storms cut a four to five mile path of destruction and damaged about half a dozen buildings from Round Lake to Wildwood."We've had sirens go off many times before. And you never think it's going to be as bad as it is. This is terrible," Alison Dalton said.A new skate park was also tossed around, landing near the swimming pool across the street."I thought these were really planted in the ground, but apparently they're not. It must have been really strong to move all these big ramps," Michael Knapik said.Despite the damage, the school plans to open on time next week.In nearby Round Lake, a popular restaurant was destroyed and several homes were damaged . But no one was injured.No one was injured in Chicago, but the storms uprooted trees in Rogers Park and Edgewater on the city's North Side."The tree coming down, the damage from that, is moderate to extensive. It'll take a while for them to clean this up," Dick Thomas said.More than 500 calls were made to 911, city officials said, during the storm."We remove the trees from property, meaning it's on your property, on your house, your business. We also clear the streets. Once we do that, we move on to things like this one, that is partially blocking the street," Commissioner Charles Williams, Chicago Streets and Sanitation, said.Hail damage was also reported."I have about six holes about this big in a bunch of my screens from hail ripping through them. I've never had that happen before," Beth Jones said.At the height of the storm, about 120,000 ComEd customers were without power.As of 9 p.m., about 3,600 people remain without power, mainly in Lake County, and will be restored once crews have safely secured the downed trees. ComEd set up a mobile unit in Grayslake to help customers and make sure crews are ready to go to areas as soon as they're given the OK.The final day of Lollapalooza, one of Chicago's biggest music festivals, ended about 30 minutes early because of severe weather. A few of Sunday's final acts, including Florence and the Machine, had to shorten their performances."It's better to be safe than sorry. And they made a call. And they did it appropriately. And the good news is we, obviously, on the 11th year Lollapalooza, and they practice for emergencies, weather-related. And they were prepared," Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. Grant Park was briefly evacuated Sunday afternoon due to approaching storms. Lollapalooza artists returned to the stage around 4 p.m.Stewart is realizing that he hasn't wounded Fox News quite as much as he might have liked.
Moab Easter Jeep Safari. I did Top Of The World trail, and had a great time. The following pics were taken on an outing which happened to turn out as a mud trip because the road to the trail head was blocked. Meet Jessi's '87 V6 4Runner You import tuners can dream about bringing in a skyline all day but this is what I would have. Somebody convince GM they should produce this. I'll trade the on board hot water & all wheel drive features for a factory locker & low range. This is a pic I put together just for kicks. This is my other car, a Fiber Fab Avenger. It is a kit car made in the '70s. Based on a VW chassis with a '92 Subaru 2.2L H4 It has all the wiring in a box waiting. I have had this since I was 16 (also when this pic was taken)but have yet to put it all together.

An archaeological city dating back 1,700 years has been unearthed during excavations in İzmir’s Kemalpaşa neighborhood, raising officials’ hopes the area will draw tourists’ attention.The Cultural Beings and Museums’ General Director Osman Murat Süslü held a press conference Oct. 21 regarding the discovery of the archaeological city, which Culture and Tourism Minister Ertuğrul Günay has defined as “good news that will draw the world’s attention.”Drilling work had started in the area, which is now categorized as a third degree archaeological site, before the construction of a warehouse company was scheduled to begin. Excavations were begun due to an abundance of signs the area may be a hotspot for archaeological treasures, Süslü said. “Scientific excavations started Oct. 1 and a layer from the 4th Century B.C. has been unearthed,” he said.The newly-unearthed city is believed to date back to around the late Roman or Byzantium period, Süslü said. It was home to a 550-square-meter villa complex with 105-centimeter-thick walls, water channels and 11 rooms.Precious mosaics were found in six of the villa complex’s rooms. “The mosaics are decorated with animal and plant figures that you cannot see anywhere today. They created the Anatolian panther, the Anatolian tiger as well as a partridge and a rabbit [in mosaics]. They are decorated with completely natural stones. You can see various shades of red, blue and green. There is a rich archaeological structuring in the region,” he said.According to Süslü, the historic structure in the city could be defined as the “Zeugma of the West,” but the most sorrowful thing was the illegal excavations. Zeugma is the ancient city known for its rich mosaics in the southeastern province of Gaziantep.Artifacts unearthed during illegal excavations from Zeugma were sold abroad at trifling prices and later major efforts were put underway to bring those artifacts back, Süslü said.Süslü warned those involved in illegal excavations that there would be repercussions to their actions. “These people should know that we pay for artifacts when they inform us [of their discovery]. Citizens should prevent illegal excavations when they see [them happening].”Further, more detailed information about the name and estimated size of the newly-discovered city in İzmir would be given as a result of detailed excavation works, Süslü said. “It is known that there are lost cities in Anatolia. Works will tell us which lost city this is.”In February, 2015, neurologist Oliver Sacks – arguably the world's best-known brain doctor and the greatest physician writer in English, wrote an article in The New York Times called My Own Life, announcing that "my luck has run out."
In the gaming tests I used a GeForce 9300 motherboard and paired it up with a Celeron 430 to show what a faster CPU could get you with the same graphics used on an Ion platform. I tested with both single and dual channel DDR2-800 memory configurations here, and overclocked the 9300 to the 9400's GPU speeds.Four months before Christmas, Sarah and Matthieu Scarangelo were in a car crash, of which Sarah and her unborn baby were the only survivors. On Christmas Eve, Sarah stays home alone, where she grieves her husband and prepares to go to the hospital the next morning for the delivery. As night falls, a woman knocks on Sarah's door asking to use the phone. When she refuses, the woman reveals that she knows Sarah and tries to force her way in. Sarah calls the police; they inspect the home and determine the woman has left, but promise to keep watch over Sarah through the night. The woman returns and tries to take Sarah's unborn child, but Sarah locks herself in the bathroom. The strange woman torments Sarah through the night and kills all who try help her.

Quan Chi is officially introduced into Scorpion's rivalry with Sub-Zero in the main MK storyline, starting with Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997). Scorpion is featured therein as an unplayable boss character, appearing twice throughout the game. Despite playing a minor role, his background was officially expanded in a feature on the game's official website, where his real name and that of his clan were revealed, while his yellow outfit was described as an apparent mockery of the Lin Kuei, after former Lin Kuei member Takeda developed ninjutsu before leaving the clan and forming the rival Shirai Ryu.[3] He is enlisted by Quan Chi to find a map hidden in a Shaolin temple, a task the sorcerer also gives to Sub-Zero in order to engage the two rival ninjas in mortal combat. If the player performs a killer move on Scorpion, he will reappear as another boss later in the game. In Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), Quan Chi tricks Scorpion into believing that Sub-Zero was actually involved in the deaths of his family and clan, resulting in Scorpion allying with him. In Scorpion's ending, he emerges victorious over Sub-Zero, but Quan Chi then appears to reveal the truth about the death of Scorpion's family and clan. When Quan Chi then attempts to banish Scorpion back to the underworld, Scorpion grabs onto Quan Chi just as he is teleported, sending them both into the Netherrealm.[8] A variation of this ending was seen in Sub-Zero's conclusion, when Sub-Zero stands over a fallen Scorpion before being knocked down from behind by Quan Chi, who again reveals his scheme and claims that both ninjas were pawns for the fallen Elder God Shinnok, which results in Scorpion killing Quan Chi and finally declaring Sub-Zero free of his curse.[9]
In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, an alternative-timeline retelling of the first three titles, Scorpion reprises his role from the first game in seeking vengeance against the elder Sub-Zero, the difference being that he serves Quan Chi from the start, unaware that Quan Chi is the mastermind behind the Lin Kuei clan's murder of his family and clan. Raiden, attempting to alter the timeline of the events of the first three tournaments in hopes of averting Armageddon, talks Scorpion into sparing Sub-Zero's life on the grounds that he would seek to revive the Shirai Ryu in exchange. Scorpion agrees, and indeed when he defeats Sub-Zero in the Netherrealm, he refuses to kill him, but Quan Chi convinces Scorpion otherwise by replaying a graphic vision of the Lin Kuei's slaughter of the Shirai Ryu in addition to Scorpion's wife and child. Scorpion then reappears on the tournament grounds holding Sub-Zero's incinerated skull and spinal column aloft before letting it drop and shatter on the floor.[11] Later in the game, the younger Sub-Zero (formerly Tundra) seeks revenge for his brother's death by demanding a fight with Scorpion in Shao Kahn's arena, and Quan Chi grants the request. Scorpion immediately recognizes that this is not the original Sub-Zero but his younger brother, who defeats Scorpion but is apprehended by his clan before he can finish Scorpion off, and Scorpion teleports away during the confusion.[12] He was last seen when he appears to fight Raiden in the Netherrealm but loses against the Thunder God and disappeared.[13] In his game ending, the Shirai Ryu appear before him as ghostly apparitions and reveal the truth. They aid him in Scorpion's killing Quan Chi for his deception. In Sub-Zero's ending, he learns the truth about his and Scorpion's families and offers Scorpion a chance to join him in his quest for vengeance, with Sub-Zero and Scorpion joining forces to form the new Deadly Alliance.[14]
In Mortal Kombat X, prior to his comic book prequel events, as well as his encounters with Kenshi to assist in his revival as a human and restore the Shirai Ryu as the clan's Grandmaster 25 years earlier, Scorpion still served Quan Chi. He was first seen in Johnny Cage's chapter of the game's story, allied with a now fleshed revenant Sub-Zero, killing most of the Special Force soldiers, except the high rank leaders Johnny, Sonya Blade and Kenshi, who manage to survive their assassination attempts thanks to Johnny's effort on defeating him and Sub-Zero. In story mode it is revealed that Scorpion's soul was restored to the living (along with Sub-Zero and Jax) by Raiden, who combined Quan Chi's magic with his own. Now Hanzo Hasashi once again, he reforms the Shirai Ryu clan and trains Kenshi's son, Takeda, in his fighting style. Hanzo made amends with Sub-Zero as Sub-Zero revealed that Quan Chi was responsible for the murder of Hanzo's family and clan. When the Special Forces capture Quan Chi, Hanzo and the Shirai Ryu subdue them, with Hanzo singlehandedly defeating Johnny Cage and Kenshi. Fueled by revenge, he was oblivious to Quan Chi's true plan, and ignored the Special Forces' hopes to return the other revenants to life. Freeing Quan Chi from imprisonment, Hanzo challenged Quan Chi to a final battle, with Hanzo emerging victorious. Concurrently, D'Vorah appeared after having betrayed Kotal Kahn and ended the Outworld Civil War, taking Shinnok's amulet from the now-dead Mileena. As Hanzo prepared to decapitate Quan Chi, D'Vorah throws the amulet to Quan Chi, who recites a spell to release Shinnok from the amulet. Immediately after the spell's conclusion, Quan Chi is killed, avenging Hanzo's family. However, Shinnok is returned to the physical world instantly, and Scorpion, in surprise, is immediately blasted away and knocked out by Shinnok. He is not seen again for the remainder of the story, leaving his fate, as well as many other characters, unknown.
Scorpion appeared in the first Mortal Kombat as one of two palette-swapped ninja characters along with Sub-Zero. His early origins were revealed by the series' original chief character designer John Tobias in September 2011 when he posted several pages of old pre-production character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as "[a] palette swap for 2 ninjas—a hunter and the hunted," while Tobias also considered the concepts of either one of them fleeing their clan, or a "revenge story" involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans.[20] In regards to the game's strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon recalled: "A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and so we knew that if we could take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we'd save a lot of money and we'd have two characters." Scorpion was given a yellow palette with the developers deciding that it would symbolize fire as the exact opposite to Sub-Zero's ice blue, which "prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan-type characters."[21] A third ninja swap, Reptile, was added in the third revision as a hidden character who was outfitted in green and used Scorpion's spear (along with Sub-Zero's freeze) as part of his offensive arsenal; he was devised by Boon as "a cooler version of Scorpion."[22] The original costume was created from a modified ninja-like outfit bought at a Chicago costume shop[21] and was red for filming in the first game, but a different yellow one with a quilted vest and knee-high shin guards was utilized for Mortal Kombat II.[23] This in turn made the other male ninja characters therein—Sub-Zero, Reptile, and hidden characters Smoke and Noob Saibot—palette swaps of Scorpion, with the latter two also using Scorpion's spear when players fought them separately in secret battles. Scorpion and the ninja characters were first played by Daniel Pesina, who was replaced by John Turk for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation Mortal Kombat Trilogy, while Sal Divita played the character in MK: Mythologies.
While his ninja-outfit template from the first generation of games has remained relatively unchanged over time, the software technology of the post-Mortal Kombat 4 three-dimensional releases have allowed more detailed costuming for the characters, and Scorpion's costumes were duly enhanced with objects such as two katana swords strapped to his back and his spear attached to a rope tied to his belt in Deadly Alliance,[24] and a set of ornate shoulder epaulets in Deception, in which his alternate costume was a throwback to the two-dimensional MK titles. Scorpion's MK2011 costume is his most detailed to date and inspired by his namesake, such as the character's abdomen-shaped shoulder pads, the two stinger-handled swords crisscrossed on his back, and the exoskeletal pattern on his hard-shell face mask.[25] Scorpion was included with Sub-Zero, Reptile and Ermac in a bundle of classic costumes from the first Mortal Kombat that was released as downloadable content for the 2011 reboot.[26] For Injustice: Gods Among Us, he received a new costume designed by comic artist Jim Lee.[27] In the original Mortal Kombat's fighter-selection screen, Scorpion had regular human eyes, as his identity as a resurrected specter was meant to be a mystery, but he was given solid yellow or white eyes for every release thereafter starting with MKII,[27] while actors portraying Scorpion in live-action media such as the feature films and the Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series were outfitted with opaque contact lenses in order to achieve this effect.
Scorpion yells one of two taunts at his opponents when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games and both feature films, but only one of them ("Come here!") was included in the home ports of MK and MKII due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character's phrases originated because he thought "it would be funny to have him yell out 'Get over here!' when he [threw the spear]," and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts.[28] As confirmed by Daniel Pesina,[29] that phrase was originally an idea of Kano's actor Richard Divizio, as was Scorpion's skull face, inspired by the classic film Jason and the Argonauts.[30] Twenty years after the first MK game's release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise's history, adding: "I remember people sitting in my office all day just doing this uppercut [on a speared enemy] again and again, like 'Oh my God, that feels so good.' It just became the cornerstone of [the game]."[31] MKII saw the debut of the popular phrase "Toasty!", which was voiced by series sound designer Dan Forden during a variation of Scorpion's "Flaming Skull" Fatality or at random when any of the game's characters landed an uppercut. According to Tobias, it first originated as "You're Toast!", which was a taunt bandied among the designers during game-testing sessions.[32]
Scorpion's signature special move throughout the series has him hurling a harpoon-like spear (described as a kunai) at his opponents, making him the only other character besides Kano to have a physical weapon in the first Mortal Kombat. The spear, attached to a length of rope, impales his opponents through the chest and sets them up for a free hit as Scorpion then jerks on the rope to pull them in to close range. This move was designed by Pesina, who did not like the original lasso move as it reminded him of that of Wonder Woman,[29] and inspired by the ancient Asian weapons known as a rope dart.[30] His other incumbent special throughout the series, save for Deadly Alliance, has been his Teleport Punch, where he flies offscreen during battle and then reappears to strike his opponent from behind. Scorpion additionally gained a new leg-takedown maneuver in MKII that was not well-received (Sega Saturn Magazine called it a "ridiculous" move that "no one ever used").[33] He was considered a lower-tier character by GamePro in their 1993 MKII character rankings, rating him eighth out of the game's twelve playables and describing both him and Sub-Zero as "formerly a top-tier character [who] doesn’t have much of a chance in MKII since all of the male ninjas have some poor matchups," with Scorpion faring the worst against Jax and Mileena.[34] Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine described the character as having "simple yet effective" special moves in UMK3 that "make him good for beginners, [which] doesn't stop him from being a useful character," while his "trusty" spear was "perfect for setting up combos."[33] GameSpy, in their Deception walkthrough, described the character as "a well-rounded character that has strengths in combos as well as in special and normal moves."[35] They additionally described the spear as "useful as ever" in Armageddon, adding, "Between [that and his] other special moves ... Scorpion pretty much has everything covered."[36] Prima Games' MK2011 strategy guide considered Scorpion to be well-balanced with no distinct weaknesses or advantages, while winning more than half of his fights against the game's other characters.[37] He is also a playable character for both the versus and story modes in Shaolin Monks, where his move sets in this game are largely identical to Liu Kang's with some original techniques.[38]
With the exception of the novel, Scorpion has been portrayed in alternate Mortal Kombat media as an antagonist, and his spear was never used in any sort of graphic nature as in the games. In the Mortal Kombat series produced by Malibu Comics, he is simply a specter consumed by revenge against Sub-Zero, and his spear was changed to a weapon resembling a spiked morning star that was attached to a whip-long length of either chain or rope. An altered version of his confrontation with Sub-Zero from the Midway comic was expanded in the first issue of the 1994 Blood & Thunder miniseries, by way of a one-page flashback of their fateful battle that ends with Scorpion being killed off-panel.[42] Scorpion, along with the other series characters from the first game, seeks to solve all the riddles inside Shang Tsung's mystical tome, the Tao the Zhan, in order to gain absolute power (which no one accomplishes). In the third issue, the combatants are all imprisoned inside Shang Tsung's dungeon before Scorpion appears and frees them from their bonds,[43] and in the fourth issue, when the fighters are stranded in Outworld after Raiden frees them from the dungeon, Scorpion kills Hydro, a Lin Kuei companion of Sub-Zero created exclusively for the series. Sub-Zero then destroys Scorpion's mortal form in a quick battle, and Scorpion (now an apparition) is then driven off by Raiden, who then declares that Sub-Zero was now under his protection.[44] Scorpion was additionally featured in a special #0 issue as the centerpiece of a short story titled Kombatants, which was originally published prior to the miniseries and has him facing Sub-Zero once more as the other combatants sing his praises in the background.[45] The first page of the third issue of Blood & Thunder, which showed Scorpion hurling his weapon at an off-panel Sub-Zero, was a near-exact duplicate of Kombatants' title page.[46] During the "Tournament Edition" double-issue conclusion of the miniseries, Scorpion loses a fight to Kitana, who had stopped him beforehand from killing an unconscious Sub-Zero. In the 1995 Battlewave miniseries, Outworld emperor Shao Kahn returns Scorpion to the living world using a mystical gem called the Deathstone, which also allows Kahn to resurrect an army of undead soldiers under his control with Scorpion as his general; his army replaces the mutants that engrossed his ranks. One of the warriors under Scorpion's command was the twin-fighting monk duo Siang, who had been killed by Goro in the Blood & Thunder miniseries and was resurrected but still maintained a mind of his own, and therefore wanted to escape Kahn's control; Scorpion therefore fatally stabs Siang through the heart in a mercy killing before destroying the Deathstone.[47] In a 1995 one-shot featuring Baraka, titled "Babality", Scorpion still possesses the Deathstone and attempts to abduct an Outworld mutant baby who is under Baraka's protection, but he is thwarted by Noob Saibot before Baraka destroys the gem.[48]
Scorpion was played by Chris Casamassa in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film. His rivalry with Sub-Zero is only mentioned in passing by Shang Tsung in the storyline, which instead had them both serving as his slaves under his command. Scorpion's spear was a living snake-like creature that shot from a slit in his palm and could fly to a limited extent. It is first seen when he engages in a standoff with Johnny Cage on Shang Tsung's ship, and later during his fight in the tournament against Cage that begins in a rubber tree forest, when the spear directly follows Cage until it goes completely taut with Cage just out of reach. Scorpion fires the creature a second time, but Cage dodges it and it fatally smashes into a tree. The fight continues in Scorpion's lair until Cage finally wounds Scorpion with several discarded weapons right after Scorpion performs his "Fire Breath" Fatality as an offensive move, causing Scorpion to burst into flames as he bleeds a glowing lava-like blood before exploding entirely. Scorpion's lair was constructed inside an airplane hangar and was not included in the script nor the movie novelization, in which Cage merely knocks Scorpion out in the forest with his Shadow Kick.
Dale reprised his role as Scorpion in both seasons of Tancharoen's Mortal Kombat: Legacy webseries. In a two-part episode in the 2011 first season, his story takes place in feudal Japan, when Hanzo Hasashi is the leader of the Shirai Ryu and a family man training his young son, Jubei, in combat, much to his wife's disapproval. Hanzo is later summoned to a meeting with the shogun, which turns out to be a ruse by Bi-Han (Sub-Zero) of the rival Lin Kuei clan in order to lure Hanzo away from his village and leave it open to attack, which Hanzo realizes after he finds the shogun murdered in the middle of an icy road. After subduing Sub-Zero in battle, he returns to his village to find his family slain before he himself is killed from behind by Sub-Zero. Shang Tsung appears with Sub-Zero, who reveals himself as Quan Chi. Quan Chi resurrects Scorpion as a specter and promises him revenge against Sub-Zero in exchange for his services. The dialogue of Scorpion, his family, and Sub-Zero were in Japanese with English subtitles, and the use of Scorpion's spear is faithful to the games for the first time in any alternate media in that it actually pierces Sub-Zero's chest before Scorpion reels him in for a hit, but no blood is shown.
In the 2013 second season, a flashback shows that Hanzo and Bi-Han were childhood friends but driven apart by the mutual disdain of their clans. Two decades later, the Shirai Ryu and Lin Kuei have made some effort towards reconciliation, but Hasashi, while with his wife and son, encounters Bi-Han's younger brother, Kuai Liang, who provokes a fight and is killed by Hanzo offscreen. Hanzo and Bi-Han later meet to discuss the incident, and both are shown to be honorable men committed to maintaining the truce between their clans. Bi-Han swears that there will be no repercussions against the Shirai Ryu for Kuai's death, but after the events of season one, the resurrected Hanzo (now Scorpion) is convinced of Bi-Han's culpability in his family's and clan's deaths, not knowing that Bi-Han is not responsible and is instead incensed about the attack that he believes was carried out by his own Lin Kuei warriors. In the present day, Bi-Han and Scorpion fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament, during which Scorpion stabs his spear into Bi-Han's ankle. Despite Bi-Han's pleas that he was not involved in the death of his clan and family, Scorpion rips out his spine. This storyline was played out over the seventh and eighth episodes and filmed entirely in English. Dale said that the series "challenge[s] the assumptions that [Scorpion and Sub-Zero] have always been sworn enemies—we have new layers in their story and rivalries."[50]
The character has featured in various types of merchandise during his tenure in the MK series, mostly action figures and sculptures. Hasbro released the first Scorpion figures in 1994: a 3.75" version in which his mask was blue and he was packaged with a plastic scorpion accessory, then a twelve-inch figure whose design and packaged weaponry were more in line with the games. Toy Island distributed a Scorpion figure in 1996 as part of their MK Trilogy collection, which included a pair of hookswords, and Infinite Concepts put out a Scorpion figure in 1999. Jazwares released a 6" Deception figure in 2005, and a 2006 Shaolin Monks figure that was also included as part of a Hot Topic-exclusive two-pack with Sub-Zero,[51][52] in addition to a collection of figures in 2011: a 4" figure from their MK2011 line,[53] a "Klassic" four-incher,[54] and a "Retro" figure that featured an interchangeable skull head and which was packaged with Sub-Zero, Reptile and Smoke in a box set.[55] Syco Collectibles released a host of Scorpion merchandise in 2011-2012: 10" (with glow-in-the-dark eyes) and 18" polystone statues,[56][57] along with two busts—a 1:2 scale with a 15" base and light-up eyes; and a smaller bust with an 11" base that featured a detachable head.[58][59] Pop Culture Shock distributed a life-sized bust in 2011 that featured removable shoulder pads and light-up eyes,[60] as well as a 19" statuette based on his UMK3 design as part of their "Mortal Kombat Klassics" collection.[61] A 16.5" mixed-media statue was released by the company in 2012, in which Scorpion was sculpted in a spear-throwing pose and was outfitted in all black.[62]
Scorpion is often regarded as one of the most popular and iconic characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise, and in the fighting-game genre in general. SuperGamePower gave him and Ryu from Street Fighter a shared award for the best fighter of 1996.[69] Game Informer rated Scorpion the third best fighting game character in 2009,[70] while UGO Networks ranked Scorpion second only to the series' main protagonist Liu Kang in their 2012 list of the top characters in the franchise.[71] Scorpion was rated the third best ninja character in video games by Cheat Code Central in 2011,[72] and PLAY similarly ranked him fourth on their own list in 2013.[73] Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar ranked him as the seventh best fighting game character in the genre's history, stating, "Scorpion has some tough competition in the MK franchise, but none come close to the sheer coolness of his 'undead antagonist' factor. Despite the fact that he started out as a mere palette swap, Scorpion’s appeal made him a frontrunner in every major MK game to date."[74] Complex featured Scorpion in a whole host of best-of lists: he was ranked the fifth most brutal fighter in the series[75] and the 15th best video game mascot,[76] in addition to the fourth "most dominant" fighting game character,[77] the 23rd "most badass" video game character of all time,[78] and one of video game characters who deserved their own spinoff title: "[W]hether you want to admit it or not, Scorpion runs the [MK] series more than Liu Kang ever has."[79] In 2008, IGN wrote that although Scorpion was initially a palette-swapped character, he "is actually a lot more complicated than these initial appearances let on;"[80] In 2013, he was named runner-up to Kratos as the "most bad-ass" video game character by The Ultimate Gamer.[81] Scorpion was voted the series' greatest character in a 2013 fan poll hosted by Dorkly,[82] and finished third behind Raiden and Smoke in the annual "Supreme Mortal Kombat Champion" fan polls hosted by Mortal Kombat Online in 2013[83] but was eliminated in the lower rounds in 2012 and 2014.[84][85]
As Scorpion is regularly intertwined with Sub-Zero throughout the series, they have often been paired together in regards to critical reception. They tied for second on WatchMojo's 2012 list of the most iconic fighting game characters,[86] placed fourth on their 2013 list of the top ten video-game ninjas,[87] and shared the fifth spot on the top video-game ninja list by PC World in 2009.[88] He tied with Sub-Zero at the top of Game Revolution's 2006 list of the top ten "old school" MK characters,[89] and a 2011 GamesRadar article discussed their evolution across the Mortal Kombat series, citing them as its two most popular characters.[90] Together, Scorpion and Sub-Zero were voted the fifth most iconic characters in the two decades of the PlayStation by readers of PlayStation Official Magazine – UK in 2015.[91] Scorpion also placed third, just behind Sub-Zero, in a 2016 readers poll by Hobby Consolas for the most popular character in all fighting games, with the staff noting him defeating the likes of Kazuya Mishima, Chun-Li, Fulgore and even Goku.[92] GamePro ranked Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and the other ninjas from the series third in their 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, adding that Midway Games "has turned the art of making new characters from other, different-colored characters into a science."[93] Robert Naytor of Hardcore Gaming 101 considered Ermac to be "a better fit" than Scorpion for appearing in Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, "given how much telekinesis is used throughout the game."[94]
Special moves and Fatalities have been mostly very well received, too. In 2010, IGN listed Scorpion's "Flaming Skull" as the second best MK Fatality without specifying any particular title in the series, due to how the player's perception of the character changes when he removes his mask.[95] They called it an "enduring classic", noting that the finisher was notably unchanged in future games as a result of its connection with the character.[96] His spear attack was ranked by IGN as the 76th top video-game weapon in 2012,[97] and ninth in GameSpot's 2002 list of the top ten fighting-game special moves of all time as the single most powerful yet balanced attack in the original game, as well as for its initial shock value, while deeming it "the definitive Mortal Kombat move."[98] The "Nether Gate" from MK2011 was included by FHM on their list of the game's nine most brutal Fatalities.[99] His MKII Friendship, shared with Sub-Zero and Reptile, placed in Prima Games' 2014 list of the series' top 50 Fatalities, in addition to the "Nether Gate", his stage Fatality from MK2011, and the "Flaming Skull" from the original MK.[100][101][102] We Got This Covered ranked the "Nether Gate" among the reboot's top finishers: "Sub-Zero does another spine rip in this game, but it’s not as repulsive as it was a decade ago. Scorpion, however, has found a new way to use his favorite weapon for maximum damage."[103] Paste rated it the fourth best Fatality from MK2011, in addition to rating the "Flaming Skull" as the third best finisher from the first game.[104] Complex ranked the "Flaming Skull" last in their list of the 20 best MK finishing moves in 2013, calling it "creepy to the max."[105] However, his Animality from UMK3/Trilogy (a penguin that lays an exploding egg) tied with that of Rain as the eighth worst finisher in the series according to GamePro.[106]
As a young boy, Brother Andrew had daydreams of becoming a spy and working undercover behind enemy lines. When he grew up and became a Christian, he became an undercover agent for God by delivering Bibles to Communist countries. Brother Andrew found himself in many situations where he seriously wondered if he would end up in prison or worse, but every time God came through in a miraculous way. There were several times when his car was searched from bumper to bumper yet the guards did not seem to notice the Bibles in plain view on the seat beside Brother Andrew. At one time he was talking with a Russian guard and commented that the Russians seemed to know all about him. The guard told him that God's Smuggler was required reading for the Russian police. I learned so much listening to this book and one of the things that really stuck in my mind was the fact that in Bulgaria there are churches that do not have even one Bible. At least this was true when the book was written in the sixties. Brother Andrew was so successful because he trusted God, prayed to God for help, and believed that God was with him and would answer his prayer.
I was inspired by Andrew’s life and mission to spread God’s word in some of the most difficult and dangerous places. I was awed by how many times he was able to get across the border with a van full of bibles, undetected. There were even times that his car was searched from trunk, to motor, to glove compartment, and officers did not see the bibles that were in plain sight. This was truly a testimony of God’s miraculous power and ability to do above what we ask for or think. I learned that my faith needs to be stronger. Andrew defied odds so many times because he trusted God, prayed and believed that God was with him. He was able to get into China when everyone told him it was impossible. Nothing is impossible with God! Andrew's heart for evangelism is truly inspirational and made me examine my own commitment to sharing the gospel. I was also convicted by Andrew’s self sacrifice. He and his wife were willing to sell their house so that they would have enough money to print bibles. I won’t tell you what happened, but God blessed their willingness to give up everything. The narrator of this audio book did a good job. At first I found it difficult to understand his English accent, but once I adjusted I thought he did a wonderful job. I recommend this book to everyone.

But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House — and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year. Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change. As governor of Massachusetts, he signed on to a regional cap-and-trade plan designed to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels. "The benefits (of that plan) will be long-lasting and enormous — benefits to our health, our economy, our quality of life, our very landscape. These are actions we can and must take now, if we are to have `no regrets' when we transfer our temporary stewardship of this Earth to the next generation," he wrote at the time. He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported. This issue is too important. We need determined leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward. I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.
NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi's cup runneth over in Mexico City today.He got a rapturous welcome from the Indian community in Mexico City. Then, he got President Enrique Peña Nieto's "positive and constructive support" for India's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).And to top it all, Peña Nieto personally drove PM Modi for a vegetarian dinner to Quintonil , one of the world's top 50 restaurants of 2015.The PM and Peña Nieto "Bonding over bean tacos!" tweeted external affairs ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup.Modi is the first Indian PM to go on a state visit to Mexico, since former PM Rajiv Gandhi's trip in 1986.And to be sure, there must have been a lot more than bean tacos on the table. President Peña Nieto certainly picked well for the PM, a strict vegetarian.When theworlds50best.com put the restaurant at number 35 in the world last year, it specifically mentioned its vegetarian fare."Though meat is a feature on the tasting menu, (Chef Jorge) Vallejo aims to highlight the value of fruit and vegetables, as much for their flavour as for their nutritional value. Dishes on the tasting menu include huazontles, a green vegetable that vaguely resembles broccoli, with chiapas cheese and red tomato, and nopal cactus snow," the write-up said.Quintonil has also been lauded for being environmentally conscious. A large part of the reason for India wanting NSG membership is so it can move forward in its effort to stem climate change.The restaurant then was perhaps a perfect venue for Modi and Peña Nieto to chat more about the latter's ''constructive'' NSG support."With a strong commitment to reducing the ecological footprint of its food, Quintonil also sources much of its produce from its own urban orchard. While the majority of food in Mexico travels on average some 2,500 km from origin to plate, at Quintonil much of it is picked on a daily basis and travels just 30 metres."Foodies waiting to see if Swarup would tweet what dessert PM Modi had, would have been disappointed, because Swarup didn't. If one were to guess, Modi might just have opted for something a little familiar from the dessert menu: Chikoo Pannacotta with Sweetened Corn Crumble and Chikoo Ice Cream.After all, Modi did say - in a nod to Mexico's son Octavio Paz - "I can understand what it means to be Mexican, because I am Indian".Editor’s Note: This Op-Ed was written and submitted to Breitbart Texas by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton

If you follow my twitter account or have attended the product address of CodeRage, you now that I've just made a big career change, joining Embarcadero Technologies. I've been working with Borland and Embarcadero products for over two decades, have been writing books on the technologies (well, mostly Delphi), have been a technical partner and my company was (and still remains) a sales partner in Italy. I've been in touch with the R&D team, developer relations, marketing people and product managers. But even recently I won't have envisioned joining the company. I was offered the job to help shape Delphi's future and didn't have to ponder a lot. The position I'm taking is Delphi Product Manager, although there is actually a product management team for RAD Studio, with split and shared responsibilities. I'll be based in Europe (working from home, when not on the road), where there are some of the R&D teams and a large number of Delphi customers. For Delphi developers in Europe this is good news, as it might be easier to reach me at "local" conferences and events. I'll start by attending Be-Delphi in 2 weeks. In case you are wondering, I'll keep doing some of my current activities, like keeping this blog open and active and use my personal twitter account. I'll try to put some of my (limited) free time on books writing, and make sure some of my open source projects have a future. But it is hard to tell, as I have a lot to learn right now. Needless to say I'm open for comments, use my new email address marco.cantu at embarcadero.com (but I'll keep monitoring also my older email accounts). Feel also free to use this blog for posting comments, ideas, constructive criticism... you know what I mean, we need a healthy and more relaxed community around Delphi. So, this is all for now. Stay tuned to this space for news and updates. It's a new adventure, I hope you'll enjoy it with me. Long live Delphi!
Joining Embarcadero as Delphi Product Manager Felicitaciones !!, Yo he sido usuario de Delphi no solo desde sus comienzos sino incluso desde sus precursores (empecé con Turbo Pascal a mediados de los 80s). Quiero aprovechar la invitación a aportar ideas y crítica constructiva para comentar lo siguiente: Comparto el sentimiento de muchos usuarios de que Delphi ha tomado el rumbo equivocado desde hace años Son varios los aspectos; pero, en mi caso, y pienso que en el de muchos, creo que la mayor falla es el no incluir el valor agregado más importante que, a quienes tenemos versiones empresariales, nos es más significativo : El poder compilar al menos la parte de servidor en Linux. En mi país, y, hasta donde conozco, en Latinoamérica en general, a nivel empresarial, Windows domina casi la totalidad del mercado. Por ello, tener el cliente en una plataforma Linux, no es algo atractivo para el empresario, ya que los usuarios, por la falta de un buen soporte en Linux compatible con MS-Office, requieren siempre Windows y por ello, sin importar lo bueno que hagamos un programa en Linux, no pasarán a Linux. En cambio, tener la parte de servidor Web en Linux representa un ahorro de costos muy significativo para ellos, y es el principal problema que enfrentamos cuando les llevamos nuestra solución Delphi; de hecho, en lo personal, el costo del servidor ha sido argumento para que no me dieran algunos negocios Mi petición como usuario la resumo en una línea : No actualizaré mi Delphi hasta tanto no compile al menos la parte de servidor para Linux
Joining Embarcadero as Delphi Product Manager Congrats Marco in your new role at Embarcadero. I have translated below the comment posted in Spanish by Rolando. Cheers Yanniel. "Congratulations!!, I have been a Delphi user not only from its inception but even from the time of its ancestors (I began with Turbo Pascal in the middle of the 80th). I want to take advantage of your invitation in order to provide some thoughts and constructive criticism: I share the feelings of many users about Delphi taking the wrong path since many years ago. There are many aspects; but in my case, and I believe this is also the case for many others, the major failure is not include the added-value of being able to compile to Linux at least the server side code. This is the most significant aspect for those like me having business versions. In my country, and to the best of my knowledge in Latin America, Windows dominates the market in the business area. Because of that, having the client in a Linux box is not very attractive to the entrepreneur; since the users, due to the lack of a good support of MS-Office in Linux, always require Windows. Regardless of how good is our Linux application, those users won’t change to Linux. On the other hand, having the server side (Web) in Linux brings significant savings for the entrepreneurs; that’s the main problem when we offer our Delphi solution to them. As a fact, in my personal case, the server cost was the reason to lose a few business deals. My petition as a user is summarized into one line: I won’t update my Delphi IDE until it is able to compile to Linux at least the server side." Comment by Rolando on November 18, 13:38
GREENFIELD: The second part of Obama's trip will be a campaign-funded visit to Europe and the Middle East. He'll meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, walking a fragile diplomatic tightrope. JOE TRIPPI (CBS News political analyst) [video clip]: This is a high-stakes game for Obama. He doesn't want to make any mistakes. Certainly if he does make one, make a statement that causes a problem, it'll be a huge one. GREENFIELD: But with voters concerned about the freshman senator's foreign policy and national security experience, Obama has little choice but to take the overseas gamble to shore up his credentials. For its part, the McCain camp was on the attack with a new ad. UNIDENTIFIED MALE [video clip]: He hasn't been to Iraq in years. now Obama is changing to help himself become president. GREENFIELD: There's little question that throughout this trip, Senator Obama will be walking a fine line. TRIPPI [video clip]: You want to look presidential, but you don't want to look like you're president. That could be presumptuous and it could backfire here in -- here with the electorate. GREENFIELD: This saturation coverage has already led the conservative blogosphere to offer blistering critiques of a liberal media slavishly treating Obama as a pop star, but of course, Katie, the sheer presence of media in no way guarantees favorable coverage. In some ways, it makes the possibility of a misstep that much more dangerous. COURIC: Of course, he does, as you mention, have to walk some tightropes. What do you think is the biggest potential landmine for him? GREENFIELD: You know, I think it's everything from a -- an untoward photo opportunity -- Dukakis in a tank -- to a misstatement that makes it seem to critics that he really does not know the nature of the terrain that he's -- that he's talking about. COURIC: And while the political benefits are -- are many, i.e., you know, visuals of him appearing statesmanlike with a variety of world leaders, can a single trip wipe out the perception in the minds of some that he lacks the credentials in foreign policy? GREENFIELD: Well, assuming he doesn't come back with a Mideast peace plan that all -- everybody signs on to, which is unlikely, no, but it can neutralize the fears. He doesn't have to equal McCain in that stature; he just has to make voters seem like he's OK, he knows what he's talking about.
ROBIN ROBERTS (news anchor): Well, how is he going to kind of change the perception out there? Because our latest poll shows that most Americans, even most Democrats, say that Senator John McCain would be a good commander-in-chief of the military. Fewer than half of those polled feel that way about Obama. So, what does he need to do on this trip to change that? STEPHANOPOULOS: He's got to show he can do the job, and above all, Robin, not make any mistakes on this trip. A gaffe could be a killer for Barack Obama. In Iraq, he's got a special problem. As Martha hinted at just a couple of minutes ago, he is going to be talking to commanders who disagree with the timeline he's set out for Iraq. And he -- somehow, he's got to find a way to show that he's listening to the commanders but is not giving up on his principles. That's going to be difficulty number one. Number two, in Israel, he'll face this tricky thicket of -- of questions about the Middle East peace process. Many presidential candidates have made mistakes on -- on that before. He's going to have to avoid that. In Europe, it's slightly different. In Europe, he -- he's -- he's facing a situation where he does have an advantage on foreign policy, improving America's image in the world. And somehow, he's got to express the aspirations for the United States, the aspirations of an Obama policy without appearing to criticize President Bush overseas. ROBERTS: And finally, how does McCain counter all of this attention that Obama is going to be receiving on this trip? STEPHANOPOULOS: The McCain campaign is very frustrated by this, as you know. All three evening news anchors going over to -- on this foreign soil with Barack Obama. They know he's gonna get a lot of attention. I think they will look to take quick hits every day and, of course, pounce on any mistake that Barack Obama makes. That would be the big opening for the McCain campaign. ROBERTS: All right, George, thank you as always for "The Bottom Line," and have a good weekend.
Europe in Ruins takes the fast paced, intense and surreal combat that you've come to know from Company of Heroes and combines it with persistent environment, ever changing meta-gameplay and ongoing war. The modification sees you creating and commanding your very own battalion in which you can customise with any units and upgrades you wish; Company of Heroes strategy has never had so much choice. Not only do you get to build up your battalion, but as you units battle, they will gain and retain all the experience they have earned, carrying over from battle to battle; going from green to elite! Not only do units gain veterancy, but your battalion as a whole increases in effectiveness through doctrine unlocks and other advantages. Each of these are designed so that the player can tailor their battalion to their own likes and play styles. The combinations choices are endless!Europe in Ruins: Reinforcements adds to the already ground breaking game play of Europe in Ruins by adding in the British Commonwealth, the Panzer Elite, new game mode, a bunch of new maps, the new Advantages system and a whole new back-end launcher with new innovative systems for army purchase and persistence. What is in this latest release:Sports Illustrated is releasing its annual list of the Top 100 players in the NBA and three Bucks appear on the list. Greg Monroe (63), Giannis Antetokounmpo (48) and Khris Middleton (39) all made the cut for the Top 100 this season, with two of them improving upon their ranking compared to last season.
We secured the Flip32+ here with 3M mounting foam to the middle of the quadcopter (facing the correct way) and then we proceeded to plugging in the ESCs. We use the servo cables to plug the ESCs in (the black, red and white cable) and these plug into the output pins of the flight controller. This is because the flight controller outputs information to the ESCs to control the speed of the motor. According to which flight controller you're using, each motor is numbered 1 to 4 in a specific order (as mentioned above). You need to plug the ESC connected to motor 1 into the output pin labeled 1 on the flight controller, the ESC connected to motor 2 into the pin labeled 2 etc. You also need to plug the servo cables into the pins in the correct orientation. The three coloured wires in the cable (black, red and white) correspond to ground, voltage and signal wires respectively. You therefore need to ensure that the ground wires are connected to the ground pins, the voltage wires are connected to the voltage pins and the signal wires are connected to the signal pins. You can see this demonstrated in the pictures above. Most flight controllers will have the pins labeled with which pin is ground, which pin is voltage and which pin is signal. For example, in our Flip32+ guide, you can see that the pins are labeled with G, V and 6 (the 6 is for motor 6 but this is the signal pin).Santa Monica does not have a housing crisis. The Southern Counties Association of Governments (SCAG) target for our City is 239 new units per year. This is a fair number that reflects our percentage of growth for the Southern California region. In the last three years we have approved an average of 253 new units per year. In addition we have another 1929 units (not counting 679 units in withdrawn projects) in the pipeline at various stages of approval processing. If only half of those projects go to term over the next three years we would have approved an average of another 321 units in the next three years or 1/3 more than our SCAG requirement. Simply stated we are already meeting more than our fair share of the region’s housing demand in addition to all the other benefits our small city provides to the region. In fact, Santa Monica’s population increase (2000-2010), which we can see everyday in our traffic overload, was over twice that of Los Angeles County (6.7% vs 3.1%).
In short we can stop beating ourselves up about needing more and more housing and focus instead on the consequences of this abundant housing production, particularly as its burden escalates in the future. It is already colliding with our sustainability goals. We simply do not have the water for the 8,000 new residents who are to join us in the next 20 years. In fact we do not have enough water for our current homes and businesses since we import about a third of our water from collapsing sources such as the Sierra snow pack (the expected El Nino this year will not undo four years of drought). Most of the new housing is headed toward Downtown, which does not even have an elementary school, so those students will need to go across half the town to possibly McKinley. Only one in nine of our workers live and work in the City so we cannot substantially reduce our job/housing imbalance by building more housing, since 9 of the 10 new workers will still work outside of the City adding to our peak hour traffic crushes. And there is no certainty this ratio will likely improve with the advent of the light rail next year. It may actually get worse.
Meanwhile, FHFA officials are busy making sure there’s no chance that the two entities will ever get themselves into another situation where their securitization practices are likely to encourage shoddy lending standards. Here’s WSJ from an article that was posted Wednesday afternoon:Business Insider The Ukrainian military has apparently lost three of its trained military attack dolphins in the Black Sea, RIA Novosti reports. Supposedly, the dolphins swam away from their handlers during training exercises earlier this month, though Ukraine’s Defence Ministry denied the reports. The dolphins may have swum off to mate with wild dolphins, former soviet naval officer Yury Plyachenko told RIA Novosti. He said that when this has happened in the past, they’ve come back in about a week. Supposedly, though the Ukraine Defence Ministry denies it, they restarted the military marine mammal program last year. The dolphins are trained to find underwater mines (which has been done in other military programs including Russia and the U.S.) but in the Ukraine, they are supposedly also trained to kill enemy divers with knives and pistols attached to their heads, according to RIA Novosti. Some could also be trained to place explosive devices on enemy ships. Note: there’s a Ukrainian report going around that people claim says that the trained dolphins never existed, and haven’t gotten loose, but we know that the government has denied reports of military trained dolphins in the past. Until we know more, the article stays. There’s no evidence that the dolphins were armed when they escaped their handlers. Here’s a documentary about the Soviet military dolphin program:
As if Iron Man 3 needed more villains on its roster, Marvel Studios has cast Chinese actor Xueqi Wang to play Chen Lu , who is also known as Radioactive Man in the comic book universe.At the same time, another report says Wang will not be referred to as Radioactive Man in Iron Man 3 and he will only be called Chen Lu. This second report sets up something The Daily SuperHero has heard from our one Hollywood insider.Our insider says there are whispers going around the rumor mill saying Chen Lu will definitelybe called Radioactive Man and he will only be called Chen Lu, in Tony Stark's next big screen adventure. Yet Iron Man 3serve as a platform to set him up as an Ant-Man movie villain instead.In the comics, Radioactive Man and Ant-Man have faced off against each other. And now with a solo movie in the works by writer/director Edgar Wright, it is speculated that a villain is needed in Ant-Man. This could be a solid theory since the origin of Dr. Hank Pym should be the main focus, of his first solo movie, while also setting up his own robotic creation Ultron as a potential future villain for an Avengers sequel.If any of this turns out to be true, there could still be a delay in seeing Radioactive Man on the big screen, since it remains to be seen if the Ant-Man movie is a part of Marvel's Phase Two or if it will come out after The Avengers 2 and be including in Phase Three.Here, we still believe the Ant-Man movie will be the first film after The Avengers 2—with an Ant-Man post-credits scene—and the first film of Phase Three. Stay tuned.(Ottawa, November 9, 2015) – The Ontario Civil Liberties Association (OCLA) denounces the criminal prosecution of Mr. Arthur Topham taking place in Quesnel, BC.

Perhaps because I wasn’t that impressed with the franchise’s second film, or perhaps due to bad eyesight, but I’ve been completely clueless when it came to the upcoming Night at the Museum 3 from director Shawn Levy, with Ben Stiller reprising his increasingly more unbelievable role of security guard Larry Daley. Whatever. You make two movies that gross almost a billion dollars and I don’t expect anything different. The first of the film’s many historical character to come back will be Robin Williams, who is currently in negotiations to reprise his role of Teddy Roosevelt, according to THR He portrayed Roosevelt in both of the previous Night at the Museum films, serving as Larry’s informational guidance counselor. The only thing that’s known, I suppose, is that the setting will be moved to one of the many museums in London. Which means that there must be some kind of a touring exhibit or a similar event, if Roosevelt is going to have a part to play here, and what kind of a lame exhibit brings along a Roosevelt piece that looks nothing like Roosevelt?Even though I really like a relatively subdued Williams for his roles inand, he kind of makes me uncomfortable in this role. It’s like seeing a grandparent on pain medication for the first time. That’s just me, I guess.Robin Williams is coming back in a big way here lately, with the CBS sitcom The Crazy Ones , which just received a full season order. His last appearance on TV before that was in an excellent episode of FX’s, taking part in a strip club scene that begged for tissues. He was widely seen in a portrayal of another president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in, and has a wide upcoming slate that includes the Phil Alden Robinson comedic drama, the Dito Montiel drama opposite with Bob Odenkirk, the ensemble comedy, and in Terry Jones’ sci-fi comedy Absolutely Anything , which will reunite all five surviving member s of Monty Python. That’s assuming that film should that film ever get started.So Robin has enough going on that taking on the obvious role reprisal makes sense, even though his talents are barely utilized. It’s only a matter of time before more actors start signing up, as production is set to begin in February.Below you’ll see Williams’ appearance a few weeks ago on David Letterman, where he’s just as high-energy as he’s always been. For some, that may not be a good thing. Blended From Around The Web Facebook
The progress in the region’s culinary community never stops, with new and exciting developments in the form of innovative events, new restaurants and other food-related projects always popping up. Let’s round up the latest in this week's installment of "Foodie Grab Bag."Fans of Mac Daddy’s Gourmet Grub food truck — known for offering many tasty variations on the American classic of mac ’n’ cheese — can now get their fix of cheesey goodness year-round at a permanent location. The new Mac Daddy’s Gourmet Pub and Grill opened in Mead’s Fairwood Shopping Center, at 415 W. Hastings Rd., in late November. With a sports bar vibe, the new restaurant is open for lunch and through to the late night (also for breakfast on the weekends), and offers an expanded pub fare menu of burgers, sausages, appetizers and salads in addition to all that tasty mac. We’ve written about the breadmaking mastery of local baker Shaun Thompson Duffy in the pages of thebefore ( here and here ). Now, Duffy is getting ready to open a retail bakery location in the South Perry District (in a long-vacant commercial building at 1026 E. Newark), and is asking the community for a little bit of help on Kickstarter campaign for $20,000 has less than two weeks left, and currently stands at just over $7,200 pledged.“I have been trying to open this place for some time, and we finally got the zoning changed after a year and a half,” Duffy recently told theCalled, the spot is planning a soft opening in February, and will be home to a wood-fired oven and stone grain mill, the latter of which will be used to mill all the bakery's flour from grains grown on farms in the Palouse. The hyper-local operation will also share the space with a brewery called. Duffy’s partners on the project are LINC Foods and Palouse Pint co-owner Joel Williamson, brewer Teddy Benson and Palouse Heritage Farms’ Don Scheuerman. In addition to a traditional bakery and brewery, the space is also set to feature a café.“I have contracted local farmers around the area to grow certain types of grain — all landrace and heritage grains — no modern wheat, which is very rare for a bakery to do, but I have access to one of the largest grain growing regions in the world: the Palouse,” Duffy says. “Not many bakers can say the same.”This week, we also caught the latest preview of what Indaba Coffee Roasters’ newest location, currently being constructed in the west end of Kendall Yards, is going to look like . Local firm Uptic Studios recently posted images of an outdoor pop-up counter, dubbed the “Indaba Pod,” that is planned for the roasters’ new home in a building being constructed now, called Nettleton Corners . The commercial hub is set to be the home of a few other food-related businesses, including a donut shop called Hello Sugar and a restaurant calledAlso soon coming to the growing neighborhood is a new sushi restaurant called Umi Sushi , to be located in the same building as the newly-opened Maryhill Winery Tasting Room As the holiday treating and eating season gets into full swing, make sure to stop by Hotel RL in downtown Spokane to see corporate executive chef Ricky Webster and team's spectacular, open for public viewing daily through the New Year.

I don’t know what this question means. To me “parenthood” is who I am. It’s not something to be balanced and there is no such thing as outside life. Every opportunity that my child is not with me, whether it be work or pleasure, is a missed opportunity to be with, enjoy, and train my child, AS WELL as learn myself more about God and my relationship with him. Parents are really obsessed with being a blessing to their children and we forget the the relationship primarily is that they are a blessing to us. We need to understand why we are not seeing things this way or we will keep on missing the point. I don’t know what this question means. To me “parenthood” is who I am.

If there is anything unclear or if you have a question, feel free to leave a comment. We’d gladly help you out!BENGALURU: In a windfall to legislators and ministers, both Houses of Karnataka legislature passed a bill on Monday gifting themselves a hike of roughly 75 per cent in their salaries and emoluments; which is reportedly the highest in the country till now.The exorbitant hike has been necessitated with the inclusion of some new categories of reimbursements. These include Rs 5,000 per night for each day of stay in a hotel with no fixed limits on the number of days as an allowance. In addition, they are also entitled for local transport of Rs 1,500 per day.The legislators only need to produce bills and make a claim.According to the Karnataka Ministers’ Salaries and Allowances (Amendment) Bill, 2015, the cost to the exchequer from the hikes is about Rs 44 crore.The chief minister leads the race by hiking his salary from Rs 30,000 per month to Rs 50,000, while his cabinet ministers get a hike from Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000. Their sumptuary allowance (regulated personal expenditure) has been doubled from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. A minister of state gets Rs 35,000 as salary against Rs 16,000, while the sumptuary allowance has been hiked from Rs 80,000 to Rs 2 lakh.Besides this, the CM and his ministers get hikes in the amount they spend on house rent, maintenance and travel allowances. The cost to exchequer for the CM and his ministers will be Rs 3.5 crore per annum. All these bills were passed without any discussion.Law minister T B Jayachandra, who piloted the bill, pegged the approximate additional expense to the state exchequer as Rs 44 crore per annum. The justification given in the bills for the increase in the salaries and reimbursements of the legislators is that 'there is a considerable increase in the cost of living.'The MLAs and MLCs have hiked their basic salary from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000, telephone allowance from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000, constituency allowance from Rs 15,000 to Rs 40,000, constituency travel allowance from Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000, signifying a total increase of Rs 50,000 per month in the amount that they get directly.In reimbursements, they get Rs 25 per km as travel allowance, with a daily per diem within the state of Rs 2,500. In addition to this, they get hotel stay and local travel expenses.The legislators have also made their future positions secure by giving themselves a pension of Rs 40,000 per month, against the existing pension of Rs 15,000.Salaries, allowances and reimbursements of the presideing officers of both Houses (speaker and chairman) are on par with the CM, while travel costs and hotel stay are along the lines of what is applicable to all legislators. The leaders of opposition have not been given any special position in this regard.The monthly pension of former legislators has also been hiked from Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 besides Rs 1,000 towards every year of additional serviceDisney submits plans for an omnimover boat ride
"In addition to the guide channel or trough, the ride system may also include an open bay or free-floating portion or section in which the boats are not guided by and do not contact nearby sidewalls. As long as a sufficient number of the floating vehicles are contained in and guided within the guide channel (or flowing or drive) portion or section of the ride system, other sections of the vehicle chain may be “undriven” by the water in the free-floating section or bay portion of the ride system. In this portion, the water may be relatively still or unflowing, but the boats in the vehicle chain will still follow a path between an exit of the guide channel and an entrance to the guide channel because they are pulled and/or pushed by the boats or vehicles traveling in the guide channel (where water is flowing to push the boats along the path between adjacent sidewalls). In the open bay or free-floating portion, the boats or vehicles may even be caused to traverse over land or out of the water by placing ramps in the path of the boats and providing pads or rollers/wheels on the bottom of the boat hulls/bodies. The pushing and pulling forces provided along the vehicle chain by the boats in the guide channel due to the flowing water will roll the boats in the open bay or free-floating portion over the dry or shallow portion of the ride. By including an open waterway in the ride system, the ride experience is enhanced as the boats appear to be magically guided and propelled through the still water with their boats spaced apart from guiding sidewalls."
Being within an anxiety reaction feels so real, and the anxiety feels so much a part of me that to deny it would be to deny myself. I try saying to myself “it’s just anxiety, it’s just anxiety,” but part of me fights back, proving to myself it is real and valid, and I experience rushes of emotional energy, and I am flooded by negative thoughts, fantasies and future projections. In these moments, when I’ve missed the opportunity – I direct myself to breathe, I feel the waves of anxiety pass over me. It feels extremely uncomfortable and unbearable, but I tell myself it will end, it can't last forever, it has to end eventually. I speak self-forgiveness to understand where the reaction came from in order to trace it back to the thoughts or memories that triggered it. This is what the tool of self-forgiveness allows one to do. I have to continuously pull myself back into my body, even f it feels exceptionally uncomfortable in there. I pull myself out of my mind, because I understand that is where it is all taking place. I try to keep myself as physical as possible, feeling my body and focusing on what I’m doing. Continue to do these steps, to focus on breathing and self-acceptance. Embrace and accept self within the reaction - do not perpetuate it by judging self or becoming angry or upset. Watch for the thoughts/emotions/memories/fantasies that will come to fuel the anxiety. Gently but firmly direct oneself to stop thinking about them, and focus on the moment Here. The anxiety will end, and things will go back to normal in a matter of time. It's just a matter of time.
Now, in retrospect, Friedman was too sanguine about what QE could do. It's not enough to just increase the money supply. The increase has to be permanent. Nor is it enough to just say it will be permanent. People have to believe it will be permanent. And that's not easy for an independent central bank to do. As Paul Krugman put it back in 1998, a central bank has to "credibly promise to be irresponsible" if it wants to increase inflation. But central banks are nothing if not responsible nowadays, and have trouble convincing us otherwise. They -- and we -- have become the victims of their inflation-fighting success now that a little more inflation is what we need.This HTML version of is provided for convenience, but it is not the best format for the book.

You can buy this book at Amazon.com Chapter 7 Prediction 7.1 The Boston Bruins problem In the 2010-11 National Hockey League (NHL) Finals, my beloved Boston Bruins played a best-of-seven championship series against the despised Vancouver Canucks. Boston lost the first two games 0-1 and 2-3, then won the next two games 8-1 and 4-0. At this point in the series, what is the probability that Boston will win the next game, and what is their probability of winning the championship? As always, to answer a question like this, we need to make some assumptions. First, it is reasonable to believe that goal scoring in hockey is at least approximately a Poisson process, which means that it is equally likely for a goal to be scored at any time during a game. Second, we can assume that against a particular opponent, each team has some long-term average goals per game, denoted λ. Given these assumptions, my strategy for answering this question is Use statistics from previous games to choose a prior distribution for λ. Use the score from the first four games to estimate λ for each team. Use the posterior distributions of λ to compute distribution of goals for each team, the distribution of the goal differential, and the probability that each team wins the next game. Compute the probability that each team wins the series. To choose a prior distribution, I got some statistics from http://www.nhl.com, specifically the average goals per game for each team in the 2010-11 season. The distribution is roughly Gaussian with mean 2.8 and standard deviation 0.3. The Gaussian distribution is continuous, but we’ll approximate it with a discrete Pmf. thinkbayes provides MakeGaussianPmf to do exactly that: def MakeGaussianPmf(mu, sigma, num_sigmas, n=101): pmf = Pmf() low = mu - num_sigmas*sigma high = mu + num_sigmas*sigma for x in numpy.linspace(low, high, n): p = scipy.stats.norm.pdf(x, mu, sigma) pmf.Set(x, p) pmf.Normalize() return pmf mu and sigma are the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution. num_sigmas is the number of standard deviations above and below the mean that the Pmf will span, and n is the number of values in the Pmf. Again we use numpy.linspace to make an array of n equally spaced values between low and high, including both. norm.pdf evaluates the Gaussian probability density function (PDF). Getting back to the hockey problem, here’s the definition for a suite of hypotheses about the value of λ. class Hockey(thinkbayes.Suite): def __init__(self): pmf = thinkbayes.MakeGaussianPmf(2.7, 0.3, 4) thinkbayes.Suite.__init__(self, pmf) So the prior distribution is Gaussian with mean 2.7, standard deviation 0.3, and it spans 4 sigmas above and below the mean. As always, we have to decide how to represent each hypothesis; in this case I represent the hypothesis that λ=x with the floating-point value x. 7.2 Poisson processes In mathematical statistics, a process is a stochastic model of a physical system (“stochastic” means that the model has some kind of randomness in it). For example, a Bernoulli process is a model of a sequence of events, called trials, in which each trial has two possible outcomes, like success and failure. So a Bernoulli process is a natural model for a series of coin flips, or a series of shots on goal. A Poisson process is the continuous version of a Bernoulli process, where an event can occur at any point in time with equal probability. Poisson processes can be used to model customers arriving in a store, buses arriving at a bus stop, or goals scored in a hockey game. In many real systems the probability of an event changes over time. Customers are more likely to go to a store at certain times of day, buses are supposed to arrive at fixed intervals, and goals are more or less likely at different times during a game. But all models are based on simplifications, and in this case modeling a hockey game with a Poisson process is a reasonable choice. Heuer, Müller and Rubner (2010) analyze scoring in a German soccer league and come to the same conclusion; see http://www.cimat.mx/Eventos/vpec10/img/poisson.pdf. The benefit of using this model is that we can compute the distribution of goals per game efficiently, as well as the distribution of time between goals. Specifically, if the average number of goals in a game is lam, the distribution of goals per game is given by the Poisson PMF: def EvalPoissonPmf(k, lam): return (lam)**k * math.exp(-lam) / math.factorial(k) And the distribution of time between goals is given by the exponential PDF: def EvalExponentialPdf(x, lam): return lam * math.exp(-lam * x) I use the variable lam because lambda is a reserved keyword in Python. Both of these functions are in thinkbayes.py . 7.3 The posteriors Now we can compute the likelihood that a team with a hypothetical value of lam scores k goals in a game: # class Hockey def Likelihood(self, data, hypo): lam = hypo k = data like = thinkbayes.EvalPoissonPmf(k, lam) return like Each hypothesis is a possible value of λ; data is the observed number of goals, k. With the likelihood function in place, we can make a suite for each team and update them with the scores from the first four games. suite1 = Hockey('bruins') suite1.UpdateSet([0, 2, 8, 4]) suite2 = Hockey('canucks') suite2.UpdateSet([1, 3, 1, 0]) Figure 7.1 shows the resulting posterior distributions for lam. Based on the first four games, the most likely values for lam are 2.6 for the Canucks and 2.9 for the Bruins. 7.4 The distribution of goals To compute the probability that each team wins the next game, we need to compute the distribution of goals for each team. If we knew the value of lam exactly, we could use the Poisson distribution again. thinkbayes provides a method that computes a truncated approximation of a Poisson distribution: def MakePoissonPmf(lam, high): pmf = Pmf() for k in xrange(0, high+1): p = EvalPoissonPmf(k, lam) pmf.Set(k, p) pmf.Normalize() return pmf The range of values in the computed Pmf is from 0 to high. So if the value of lam were exactly 3.4, we would compute: lam = 3.4 goal_dist = thinkbayes.MakePoissonPmf(lam, 10) I chose the upper bound, 10, because the probability of scoring more than 10 goals in a game is quite low. That’s simple enough so far; the problem is that we don’t know the value of lam exactly. Instead, we have a distribution of possible values for lam. For each value of lam, the distribution of goals is Poisson. So the overall distribution of goals is a mixture of these Poisson distributions, weighted according to the probabilities in the distribution of lam. Given the posterior distribution of lam, here’s the code that makes the distribution of goals: def MakeGoalPmf(suite): metapmf = thinkbayes.Pmf() for lam, prob in suite.Items(): pmf = thinkbayes.MakePoissonPmf(lam, 10) metapmf.Set(pmf, prob) mix = thinkbayes.MakeMixture(metapmf) return mix For each value of lam we make a Poisson Pmf and add it to the meta-Pmf. I call it a meta-Pmf because it is a Pmf that contains Pmfs as its values. Then we use MakeMixture to compute the mixture (we saw MakeMixture in Section 5.6). Figure 7.2 shows the resulting distribution of goals for the Bruins and Canucks. The Bruins are less likely to score 3 goals or fewer in the next game, and more likely to score 4 or more. 7.5 The probability of winning To get the probability of winning, first we compute the distribution of the goal differential: goal_dist1 = MakeGoalPmf(suite1) goal_dist2 = MakeGoalPmf(suite2) diff = goal_dist1 - goal_dist2 The subtraction operator invokes Pmf.__sub__ , which enumerates pairs of values and computes the difference. Subtracting two distributions is almost the same as adding, which we saw in Section 5.4. If the goal differential is positive, the Bruins win; if negative, the Canucks win; if 0, it’s a tie: p_win = diff.ProbGreater(0) p_loss = diff.ProbLess(0) p_tie = diff.Prob(0) With the distributions from the previous section, p_win is 46%, p_loss is 37%, and p_tie is 17%. In the event of a tie at the end of “regulation play,” the teams play overtime periods until one team scores. Since the game ends immediately when the first goal is scored, this overtime format is known as “sudden death.” 7.6 Sudden death To compute the probability of winning in a sudden death overtime, the important statistic is not goals per game, but time until the first goal. The assumption that goal-scoring is a Poisson process implies that the time between goals is exponentially distributed. Given lam, we can compute the time between goals like this: lam = 3.4 time_dist = thinkbayes.MakeExponentialPmf(lam, high=2, n=101) high is the upper bound of the distribution. In this case I chose 2, because the probability of going more than two games without scoring is small. n is the number of values in the Pmf. If we know lam exactly, that’s all there is to it. But we don’t; instead we have a posterior distribution of possible values. So as we did with the distribution of goals, we make a meta-Pmf and compute a mixture of Pmfs. def MakeGoalTimePmf(suite): metapmf = thinkbayes.Pmf() for lam, prob in suite.Items(): pmf = thinkbayes.MakeExponentialPmf(lam, high=2, n=2001) metapmf.Set(pmf, prob) mix = thinkbayes.MakeMixture(metapmf) return mix Figure 7.3 shows the resulting distributions. For time values less than one period (one third of a game), the Bruins are more likely to score. The time until the Canucks score is more likely to be longer. I set the number of values, n, fairly high in order to minimize the number of ties, since it is not possible for both teams to score simultaneously. Now we compute the probability that the Bruins score first: time_dist1 = MakeGoalTimePmf(suite1) time_dist2 = MakeGoalTimePmf(suite2) p_overtime = thinkbayes.PmfProbLess(time_dist1, time_dist2) For the Bruins, the probability of winning in overtime is 52%. Finally, the total probability of winning is the chance of winning at the end of regulation play plus the probability of winning in overtime. p_tie = diff.Prob(0) p_overtime = thinkbayes.PmfProbLess(time_dist1, time_dist2) p_win = diff.ProbGreater(0) + p_tie * p_overtime For the Bruins, the overall chance of winning the next game is 55%. To win the series, the Bruins can either win the next two games or split the next two and win the third. Again, we can compute the total probability: # win the next two p_series = p_win**2 # split the next two, win the third p_series += 2 * p_win * (1-p_win) * p_win The Bruins chance of winning the series is 57%. And in 2011, they did. 7.7 Discussion As always, the analysis in this chapter is based on modeling decisions, and modeling is almost always an iterative process. In general, you want to start with something simple that yields an approximate answer, identify likely sources of error, and look for opportunities for improvement. In this example, I would consider these options: I chose a prior based on the average goals per game for each team. But this statistic is averaged across all opponents. Against a particular opponent, we might expect more variability. For example, if the team with the best offense plays the team with the worst defense, the expected goals per game might be several standard deviations above the mean.
To take advantage of all available information, we could use results from all regular season games to estimate each team’s goal scoring rate, possibly adjusted by estimating an additional factor for each pairwise match-up. This approach would be more complicated, but it is still feasible. For the first option, we could use the results from the regular season to estimate the variability across all pairwise match-ups. Thanks to Dirk Hoag at http://forechecker.blogspot.com/, I was able to get the number of goals scored during regulation play (not overtime) for each game in the regular season. Teams in different conferences only play each other one or two times in the regular season, so I focused on pairs that played each other 4–6 times. For each pair, I computed the average goals per game, which is an estimate of λ, then plotted the distribution of these estimates. The mean of these estimates is 2.8, again, but the standard deviation is 0.85, substantially higher than what we got computing one estimate for each team. If we run the analysis again with the higher-variance prior, the probability that the Bruins win the series is 80%, substantially higher than the result with the low-variance prior, 57%. So it turns out that the results are sensitive to the prior, which makes sense considering how little data we have to work with. Based on the difference between the low-variance model and the high-variable model, it seems worthwhile to put some effort into getting the prior right. The code and data for this chapter are available from http://thinkbayes.com/hockey.py and http://thinkbayes.com/hockey_data.csv. For more information see Section 0.3. 7.8 Exercises Exercise 1 If buses arrive at a bus stop every 20 minutes, and you arrive at the bus stop at a random time, your wait time until the bus arrives is uniformly distributed from 0 to 20 minutes. But in reality, there is variability in the time between buses. Suppose you are waiting for a bus, and you know the historical distribution of time between buses. Compute your distribution of wait times. Hint: Suppose that the time between buses is either 5 or 10 minutes with equal probability. What is the probability that you arrive during one of the 10 minute intervals? I solve a version of this problem in the next chapter. Exercise 2 Suppose that passengers arriving at the bus stop are well-modeled by a Poisson process with parameter λ. If you arrive at the stop and find 3 people waiting, what is your posterior distribution for the time since the last bus arrived. I solve a version of this problem in the next chapter. Exercise 3 Suppose that you are an ecologist sampling the insect population in a new environment. You deploy 100 traps in a test area and come back the next day to check on them. You find that 37 traps have been triggered, trapping an insect inside. Once a trap triggers, it cannot trap another insect until it has been reset. If you reset the traps and come back in two days, how many traps do you expect to find triggered? Compute a posterior predictive distribution for the number of traps. Exercise 4 Suppose you are the manager of an apartment building with 100 light bulbs in common areas. It is your responsibility to replace light bulbs when they break. On January 1, all 100 bulbs are working. When you inspect them on February 1, you find 3 light bulbs out. If you come back on April 1, how many light bulbs do you expect to find broken? In the previous exercise, you could reasonably assume that an event is equally likely at any time. For light bulbs, the likelihood of failure depends on the age of the bulb. Specifically, old bulbs have an increasing failure rate due to evaporation of the filament. This problem is more open-ended than some; you will have to make modeling decisions. You might want to read about the Weibull distribution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution). Or you might want to look around for information about light bulb survival curves.Watch: President Trump sings along to “Star-Spangled Banner” at Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington Nat’l Cemetery https://t.co/bUoHsX8HJf — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 29, 2017
Browser support for WebGL security servicing responsibility relies too heavily on third parties to secure the web experience As WebGL vulnerabilities are uncovered, they will not always manifest in the WebGL API itself. The problems may exist in the various OEM and system components delivered by IHV’s. While it has been suggested that WebGL implementations may block the use of affected hardware configurations, this strategy does not seem to have been successfully put into use to address existing vulnerabilities. It is our belief that as configurations are blocked, increasing levels of customer disruption may occur. Without an efficient security servicing model for video card drivers (eg: Windows Update), users may either choose to override the protection in order to use WebGL on their hardware, or remain insecure if a vulnerable configuration is not properly disabled. Users are not accustomed to ensuring they are up-to-date on the latest graphics card drivers, as would be required for them to have a secure web experience. In some cases where OEM graphics products are included with PCs, retail drivers are blocked from installing. OEMs often only update their drivers once per year, a reality that is just not compatible with the needs of a security update process.
The hostess said, “When I was a girl, Sabbath in Father’s home boasted more guests than we now host in an entire week. And each guest would find meat and fish and all types of tasty treats. Afterwards father would pay them for having allowed him to perform the mitzvah of welcoming guests. And now his daughter receives payment from her guests for each and every slice of bread they eat under her roof. A person moves to the Land of Israel to increase his mitzvot, and in the end he cannot keep even those mitzvot he would have fulfilled in Exile. I saw you looking at my tin candlesticks. Those aren’t the same candlesticks I brought from my father’s home. Those were made of silver but were sold off the first year we arrived here in the Land of Israel. The ones I lit tonight were purchased from a woman who returned abroad last year. In the meantime what did I use as candlesticks? Don’t ask, my friend, don’t ask. If my heart didn’t break from embarrassment, the earthenware candlesticks I used at that time broke on account of my anguish. Now, thank God, we live like most of those in the Land of Israel—neither with comfort and wealth, nor with paucity and poverty.”
On my way back to the hotel from synagogue I met a certain man. He extended his hand, greeted me, and asked, “Aren’t you embarrassed that you’re in Haifa and haven’t come to visit me?!” I explained that I had arrived in town right at the onset of Shabbat. “Where did you spend the night?” I told him on the floor of a certain hotel, to which he said, “You could have found a floor at my place, but with fewer mosquitoes than in that hotel. My room is small, but there’s enough space for a man and his friend. I’d be glad to show you some hospitality and repay the favor you showed me when I stayed with you in Jaffa at the annual conference of Poel HaTzair. Let’s go eat and drink a bit, then we can take a walk and see the city and all our friends here in Haifa. It’s true, I’ve since left the party, but I haven’t left my friends. A person can change his political positions, but never his friends! I still subscribe to the Poel HaTzair newspaper. Whether I agree or disagree with what’s published in it I still read the whole thing. Either out of habit or because there’s no newspaper in this country that isn’t a mouthpiece for one political party or another. Oh my, you must be hungry and here I am going on and on about philosophy and sociology. Let’s go eat before the olives and cucumbers get cold!”
After a few hours I told him how wonderful it was to sit and listen to all he has to tell, but that the time had come to return to my hotel. He said, “All this food is still here and you’re already looking for another place? Even if they had prepared a big meal for you at the hotel others have surely come and eaten it already, for a boatload of Jews docked just last night. Ships come and ships go, these bring Jews to the Land and those ferry Jews away. If only 1 percent of those who arrived were to remain the Land would be overflowing with Jews. Maybe you met a certain Jew at the inn named Velvel Shumer? He was the cantor in our town. On account of disagreements between him and the synagogue leaders he left his position and came to the Land of Israel. Tomorrow or the next day he’ll be returning to the old country and thus add one more set of lips defaming the Land, since he didn’t find what he was looking for here. And what did he want? A pair of hands that never did a day’s labor aren’t suited to hold a hoe. And our synagogues aren’t looking to hire cantors, since all Jews here are presumed to know how to lead the services. Tell me, what did you think of our meal? Wasn’t it better than anything one can expect to eat at one of the hotels around here? Not out of commitment to Tolstoyism do I prepare my own food with my own two hands, but because of my desire to settle the Land. Many of our friends have left because of the food in the local eateries, which causes all types of stomach illness. Now let’s rest a bit, then we can walk about and see the town and her people, the Hadar neighborhood and the Technion, and if you have enough energy we can climb up Mount Carmel.”
He sat and said, “You mentioned that the innkeeper’s wife had said that a person moves to the Land of Israel to increase his mitzvot and good deeds, and in the end cannot keep even those he was accustomed to perform in Exile. Isn’t that what she said?” I told him that was it, more or less. Shmarya said, “It’s the truth.” I told him that from what I knew of his life I hadn’t thought he had moved here on account of mitzvot and good deeds. Shmarya said, “Not on account of mitzvot and good deeds, but in order to work the Land of Israel. Maybe I mentioned to you that I was a villager back home, and I grew up working the land. Both my father’s and mother’s families as well. We had heard tales of Jews living off the land here. From that point on father would say, ‘If only most of my days weren’t behind me, I would sell my house and fields and take my wife and son up to the Land of Israel and buy myself a colony.’ He became sick and died, but I have done what he did not live to do. I sold off my share of the inheritance and came up to the Land, but before I could purchase a plot of land I lost all my money. If you want to know how—some of the money at the hands of honest folks, and most of it at the hands of swindlers. I was suddenly left empty-handed and did as most of our friends have done, hiring myself out for work. The condition of our friends is well-known to you. So as not to discourage the Zionists abroad I never even hinted what’s happened to me in letters to my mother or to my relatives. One day a letter arrived from mother, telling me that since my younger sister had wed and gone off to live in the city with her husband, there’s no reason for her to remain behind with the goyim in the village. She asked me to purchase a small plot of land for her next to my colony, and build her a small dwelling where she could live out the remainder of her days, and at the end of a long life be buried in the Holy Land. So as not to delay her arrival, she asked that I begin construction right away, and she sent money to get started on building her a place with a bedroom and separate kitchen. I wanted to write to her and let her know all that has befallen me here, and how I’ve lost my money, but I didn’t have the heart to disappoint her, so I told her I would do as she asked. One day a notice arrived from the bank that a sum of money had arrived for me and was awaiting my withdrawal to put to use. I told myself that it would be best to let mother’s money sit in the bank. I won’t lay a finger on it.”
Prefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with infix notation. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed arity each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a stack, until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a push-down store with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this parsing.
A description of the hotel on Booking.com described it as having “cosy bedrooms” which were traditionally decorated. On the LateRooms website, the hotel was said to be “famous for live entertainment and excellent cuisine.” It added: “We are located on the edge of Blackpool’s newly developed South beach Promenade. Perfectly situated for the Pleasure Beach, Sandcastle Water Park, the Grosvenor Casino and just a short walk away from the center of Blackpool. Whether you want a fun filled holiday or just a relaxing break, our Blackpool Hotel can cater for both.”The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa (Krakatau) in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) began in the afternoon of Sunday, 26 August 1883 (with origins as early as May of that year), and peaked in the late morning of Monday, 27 August 1883, when over 70% of the island and its surrounding archipelago were destroyed as it collapsed into a caldera. Additional seismic activity was reported to have continued until February 1884, though reports of seismic activity after October 1883 were later dismissed by Rogier Verbeek's investigation into the eruption. The 1883 eruption was one of the deadliest and most destructive volcanic events in recorded history. At least 36,417 deaths are attributed to the eruption and the tsunamis it created. Significant additional effects were also felt around the world in the days and weeks after the volcano's eruption.
On August 27, four enormous explosions occurred. At 5:30 am, the first explosion was at Perboewatan, triggering a tsunami heading straight to Telok Betong, now known as Bandar Lampung. At 6:44 am, Krakatoa exploded again at Danan, with the resulting tsunami stretching eastward and westward. The largest explosion, at 10:02 am, was so violent that it was heard 3,110 km (1,930 mi) away in Perth, Western Australia, and the Indian Ocean island of Rodrigues near Mauritius, 4,800 km (3,000 mi) away, where they were thought to be cannon fire from a nearby ship. The third explosion has been reported as the loudest sound heard in historic times.[2][3][4]:79 The loudness of the blast heard 160 km (100 mi) from the volcano has been calculated to have been 180 dB.[5] Each explosion was accompanied by tsunamis estimated to have been over 30 meters (98 feet) high in places. A large area of the Sunda Strait and a number of places on the Sumatran coast were affected by pyroclastic flows from the volcano. The energy released from the explosion has been estimated to be equal to about 200 megatons of TNT,[6] roughly four times as powerful as the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated. At 10:41 am, a landslide tore off half of Rakata volcano, along with the remainder of the island to the north of Rakata, causing the final explosion.[2]

CZ P-06 Same as the P-01 but in .40 S&W
CZ 75 SP-01/SP-01 Tactical Similar to the P-01 with accessory rail, but with all-steel construction and utilizing the full-size frame and slide as well as incorporating extended-capacity 18-round magazines. It is available with an ambidextrous manual safety (SP-01) or with an ambidextrous decocker (SP-01 Tactical). The CZ 75 (SP-01) was designed for multiple purposes including but not limited to: a military/law enforcement duty sidearm, sidearm for counter-terrorism forces, and field/target shooting.[6] Used in the 2005 IPSC World Shoot XIV by World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in the production division).[7] CZ 75 SP-01 Shadow New generation of CZ 75 SP-01 pistol especially adapted according to suggestions as proposed by users from communities worldwide, with an additional input from the Team CZ shooters Angus Hobdell and Adam Tyc. Based on the SP-01, it has no firing pin block resulting in improved trigger travel. It also features a slightly reshaped grip and safety, a “weaker” recoil spring for easier loading, and fiber optic front sight and tactical “Novak style” rear sight.[8] CZ 75 Shadow 2 In 2016, with the cooperation of the elite IPSC shooters of the Česká zbrojovka team, an improved version of the Shadow was released, called the Shadow 2. It included a longer barrel, a reshaped, lighter-weight slide, more aggressive slide serrations, improved grip ergonomics, aggressive grip checkering, and a smaller fiber optic in the front sight.
CZ 75 SP-01 Phantom The CZ 75 Phantom has a polymer frame, is 33% lighter than steel frame models, with accessory rail and a forged steel slide with a weight saving scalloped profile. Two Interchangeable grip rear strap inserts are included with the Phantom to accommodate users with different sized hands. The pistol is further outfitted with a decocking lever. Czech Army Paratroopers of the 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade are fully equipped with this pistol from January 2012. CZ 75 Standard IPSC A CZ 75 variant designed specifically for IPSC competition with extended grip, single-action trigger, heavy-duty free-falling magazines, and an enlarged magazine well.

CZ 75 Kadet/Kadet 2 A .22 LR caliber slide/ barrel assembly and magazine kit to fit onto most standard CZ 75B frames (except the Tactical Sport and SP-01 Phantom). The Kadet also used to be sold as a complete pistol (slide assembly and frame), but is now only sold as a slide assembly to be mounted on existing frames. The 2nd generation conversion kit currently being sold is called the "Kadet 2", and includes a dedicated .22 slide stop that locks the slide back on an empty magazine. Night sights are optional.
CZ P-07 Duty The CZ P-07 Duty is a compact, polymer-framed CZ 75 variant notable for having a redesigned trigger mechanism. The redesign has reduced the number of parts as well as improved the trigger pull. The exterior restyling was greatly influenced by the SPHINX 3000 design (itself being an enhanced Swiss CZ 75 clone). Chambered in 9mm Luger and .40 S&W, the CZ P-07 DUTY also includes the ability to change the manual safety to a decocking lever and vice versa through an exchange of parts. Introduced in 2009. CZ P-09 Duty Full-size version of the P-07, boasting 19 round capacity in 9mm. Introduced in 2013. CZ P-09 Kadet A .22 LR caliber slide/barrel assembly and magazine kit to fit onto standard CZ P-09 frames, similar to the CZ 75 Kadet/Kadet 2. The Kadet is sold as a complete pistol (slide assembly with frame) or a standalone slide assembly to be mounted on existing frames, and can be used as a training gun for the standard P-09. The frame is made from mechanically and thermally stable polymer reinforced with glass fibre, equipped with an underside MIL-STD-1913 rail for accessories. The slide has two pairs of cocking grooves for comfortable handling, and adjustable iron sights with three luminescent dots. The gun has easy-to-change manual safety and decocking controls, with three interchangeable grip backstraps in small, medium and large sizes.
Interestingly enough, Ekman-Larsson’s career in the NHL also began overseas. Selected by the Coyotes with the sixth overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Ekman-Larsson made his debut on October 9, 2010 when the then-Phoenix Coyotes faced the Boston Bruins in Prague, Czech Republic. Ekman-Larsson recorded his first career NHL point on October 23, 2010 against the Carolina Hurricanes and notched his first career NHL goal on January 17, 2011 against the San Jose Sharks. After finishing his rookie year with 11 points in 48 games, Ekman-Larsson would begin to make his mark on the league’s landscape in his sophomore year. He racked up 32 points in the 2011-12 NHL season, which ranked second on the team in terms of scoring by defenseman and seventh on the team in overall scoring. Ekman-Larsson’s biggest offensive contribution came when he notched his first career NHL playoff goal in the second period of Game 6 of the Coyotes’ first-round series against the Chicago Blackhawks. That was the only goal he scored during the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs, but it would end up being the goal that put the Coyotes into the second round of the playoffs for the first time since moving from Winnipeg.
It's occurred to me that we have yet to provide any official recommendations with respect to best practices for operating Tor relays. This post is my attempt to define a reasonable threat model and use it to develop some recommendations. My plan is to post it here first, to subject it to review by the relay operator community. After operators have a chance to comment, the plan is to relocate the document to the Tor Wiki and/or a blog post. As always, to focus our thoughts, we start with the adversary's goals. Adversary Goals There is a significant difference between adversaries that can see inside of router-to-router TLS vs those that cannot. I believe this capability distinction governs the adversary goals in terms of compromising relays as opposed to merely externally observing them. Adversaries that can unwrap router TLS can perform every attack that an actual node can perform, at any location between the user and the node, and/or between the node and other nodes. In particular, adversaries that can see inside router TLS can perform tagging attacks (see https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-March/003361.html) as well as perform circuit-specific active and passive timing analysis. These attacks can be quite severe. An adversary that is able to obtain Guard identity keys is free to perform a tagging attack anywhere on the Internet. In other words, if the adversary is interested in monitoring a particular user, the adversary need only obtain the identity keys for that user's 3 guard nodes, and from that point on, the adversary will be able to transparently monitor everything that user does by way of using tagging to bias the users paths to connect only to surveilled exit nodes who also have had their identity keys compromised. Based on this distinction, it seems that some simple best practices can increase the costs of an adversary that wishes to compromise tor traffic. Let's now consider how the adversary goes about compromising router TLS. Attack Vectors There are two high-level vectors towards seeing inside node-to-node TLS (which uses ephemeral keys that are rotated daily and authenticated via the node's identity key). Both high-level vectors therefore revolve around node identity key theft. Attack Vector #1: One-Time Key Theft The one-time adversary is interested in performing a grab of keys and then operating transparently upstream afterwords. This adversary will take the form of a coercive request at a datacenter/ISP to extract identity node key material and from then on, operate externally as a transparent upstream MITM, creating fake ephemeral TLS keys authenticated with the stolen identity key. Tor nodes that encounter this adversary will likely see it in the form of unexplained reboots/mysterious downtime, which are inevitable in the lifespan of any Tor node. Attack Vector #2: Advanced Persistent Threat Key Theft If one-time methods fail or are beyond reach, the adversary has to resort to persistent machine compromise to retain access to node key material. The APT attacker can use the same vector as #1 or perhaps an external vector such as daemon compromise, but they then must also plant a backdoor that would do something like trawl through the RAM of a machine, sniff out the keys (perhaps even grabbing the ephemeral TLS keys directly), and transmit them offsite for collection. This is a significantly more expensive position for the adversary to maintain, because it is possible to notice upon a thorough forensic investigation during a perhaps unrelated incident, and it may trigger firewall warnings or other common least privilege defense alarms inadvertently. Unfortunately, it is also a more expensive attack to defend against, because it requires extensive auditing and assurance mechanisms on the part of the relay operator. Defenses It seems clear that the above indicates that at minimum relays should protect against one-time key compromise. Some further thought shows that it is possible to make the APT adversary's task harder as well, albeit with significantly more effort. Let's deal with defending against each vector in turn. Prevent Vector #1 (One-Time Key Theft): Deploy Ephemeral Identity Keys The simplest way to defend against the adversary who attempts to extract relay keys through a reboot is to take advantage of the fact that even node identity keys can be ephemeral, and do not need to persist long term (certainly not past a reboot). This can be achieved with a boot script that wipes your keys (they live in /var/lib/tor/keys) at startup, or by using a ramdisk: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-create-linux-ram-disk-filesystem/ Of the two, the ramdisk option is superior, since it will prevent the adversary from easily re-using your old keys after you begin using the new ones. Additionally, ssh server key theft is another one-time vector that can be used to quickly bootstrap into node key theft. For this reason, node admins should always use ssh key auth for tor node administration accounts, since it prevents ssh server key theft from implying continuous server compromise: http://www.gremwell.com/ssh-mitm-public-key-authentication Issues With Ephemeral Identity Keys There are a few issues with deploying ephemeral identity keys. Issues With Ephemeral Identity Keys: Client guard node loss The primary issue with ephemeral identity keys is client Guard node loss. If your relay obtains the Guard flag, you should endeavor to keep it. If you have planned maintenance and controlled reboots, you should copy your identity keys to a safe location prior to reboot so that clients aren't forced to rotate their guards prematurely due to unnecessary rekeying. Issues With Ephemeral Identity Keys: MyFamily The next issue is that identity key rotation makes the use of MyFamily very complicated. For large families, it's nearly impossible to update the MyFamily line of each node instance after every unexpected reboot. We've filed a bug to see if we can find a more convenient way to provide the same feature, but it's not clear that MyFamily is worth maintaining: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5565 It is very likely that the security benefit from maintaining MyFamily pales in comparison the gain from deploying ephemeral identity keys, and MyFamily should be abandoned entirely. Issues With Ephemeral Identity Keys: Tor Weather The final issue with ephemeral identity keys is that node monitoring mechanisms such as Tor Weather become difficult to use in the face of rotating keys. We've filed this bug to improve Weather's subscription mechanisms: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5564 Preventing Vector #2: Isolation Hardening and Readonly Runtime Once one-time key theft has been dealt with, you can begin to consider how to deal with the Advanced Persistent Threat. The effort required to defend against this adversary is considerable, and it is not expected that all operators will devote the effort to do so. To limit scope, we are not going to deal with the daemon compromise vector; for that see your OS least-privilege mechanisms (such as SElinux, AppArmor, Grsec RBAC, Seatbelt, etc). Instead, we will deal with how you can attempt to protect your identity keys once an adversary already has root access. If you are serious about defending against this adversary, the first thing you will want to do is disable access to the 'ptrace' system call from userland, which allows easy key theft using debugging tools. Note that all current built-in kernel mechanisms to do this still allow root users to use ptrace on arbitrary processes. In order to disable ptrace for root users, you need to load a kernel module to patch the syscall table to remove access to the syscall itself. Two options for this are: https://gist.github.com/1216637 http://people.baicom.com/~agramajo/misc/no-ptrace.c Once access to the ptrace system call is removed, you need to disable module loading to prevent it from being restored. On Linux, this is accomplished via 'sysctl kernel.modules_disabled=1'. You should perform this operation as early in the boot process as possible. One technique that works on Redhat-based systems is to place a shell script in /etc/rc.modules to load the modules you need for operation, insert the ptrace module, and then issue the sysctl to disable further module loading. Redhat-derivatives launch /etc/rc.modules first thing at the top of /etc/rc.sysinit. After that comes ensuring runtime integrity. There are several ways to achieve this, but most are easily subverted by an attacker with direct access to the hardware. The most robust approach seems to be to create a small encrypted loopback filesystem that contains all of the libraries required to run the 'tor' process as well as all of the requisite configuration files. Requisite libraries can be determined via 'ldd /usr/bin/tor'. The encrypted loopback filesystem doesn't need to be more than ~25M in size, but you will also need an auxillary var loopback that needs to be a hundred megs or so. Here are the commands for creating the root loopback filesystem: dd if=/dev/urandom of=./tor-root.img bs=1k count=25k losetup /dev/loop1 ./tor-root.img cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/loop1 cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop1 tor-root mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/tor-root Once this encrypted loop is created such that it can run your relay's Tor processes, you should take the sha1sum of the file and store it offsite. When you use this loopback, you will mount it readonly, and mount an unencrypted var directory inside of it, and a ramdisk for your keys inside of that: dd if=/dev/urandom of=./tor-var.img bs=1k count=200k losetup /dev/loop2 ./tor-var.img mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop2 mount /dev/mapper/tor-root /mnt/tor-root -o ro mount /dev/loop2 /mnt/tor-root/var mkfs -q /dev/ram1 128 mount /dev/ram1 /mnt/tor-root/var/lib/tor/keys cd /mnt/tor-root/ chroot . start_tor.sh Once you start your tor process(es), you will want to copy your identity key offsite, and then remove it. Tor does not need it to remain on disk after startup, and removing it ensures that an attacker must deploy a kernel exploit to obtain it from memory. While you should not re-use the identity key after unexplained reboots, you may want to retain a copy for planned reboots and tor maintenance. scp /mnt/tor-root/var/lib/tor/keys/secret_id_key offsite_backup:/mnt/usb/tor_key rm /mnt/tor-root/var/lib/tor/keys/secret_id_key Upon suspicious reboots, you can verify the integrity of your tor image by simply calculating the sha1sum (perhaps copying the image offsite first). You do not need to do anything special with the var loopback. These steps should prevent even adversaries who compromise the root account on your system (by rebooting it, for example) from obtaining your identity keys directly, forcing them to resort to kernel exploits and memory gymnastics in order to do so. Don't forget to periodically update the libraries stored on your loopback root using a trusted offsite source, as they won't receive security updates from your distribution. One alternative to make your loopback fs creation, tor startup, and maintenance process simpler is to statically compile your image's tor binary on an offsite, trusted computer. If you do this, you should no longer need to bother with chrooting your tor processes or copying libraries around. However, it still does not save you from the need to recompile that binary whenever there is a security update to the underlying libraries, and it may come at a cost of exploit resistance due to the loss of per-library ASLR. Ok, that's it. What do people think? Personally, I think that if we can require a kernel exploit and/or weird memory gymnastics for key compromise, that would be a *huge* improvement. Do the above recommendations actually accomplish that? If so, should we work on providing scripts to make the loopback filesystem creation process easier, and/or provide loopback images themselves? Even the APT defenses end up not working out, I would sleep a lot better at night if most relays deployed only the defenses to one-time key theft...

Introduction In the midst of working on this paper, I learned that a friend of ours, an extraordinarily beautiful woman in all senses of the word, found that her equally beautiful nine-month old boy has a virulent strain of muscular dystrophy. For that bright-eyed and laughing little boy with a genetic time bomb, the future points to progressive wasting, immobility, and death before adulthood. It is easy to see in this little boy the transformations already affecting his body and to feel the sharp sting of how things will unroll in time. There is a clear sense of inevitability, of time being "a river which sweeps him along." Although just as true for ourselves, we easily see in him that time is a devouring tiger and a consuming fire. Ill show that understanding something about time in Buddhism and modern physics deepens our sense of how "Time is the substance I am made of." Such understanding also helps us appreciate how we are the devouring tiger and the consuming fire. Beyond its inevitability and destruction, time has other crucial features. We can reflect on past events and learn from them, but we cannot influence them. The past has a fixity that contrasts sharply with the more malleable future, where we make choices and influence events. Therefore, we experience a directionality to time, expressed by a metaphorical arrow pointing from the past, through the present, and into the indefinite future. In contrast, the fundamental equations of physics are all time symmetric, meaning that they have no directionality in time. All the fundamental interactions can proceed in the reverse direction without violating any laws of physics. For a simple example, bounce a ball off the floor and take a movie of it. If you run the movie backwards, nothing looks strange because the time-reversed motion violates no laws of physics. Or, take a movie of our solar system from a distant star and play it backwards. All the rotations and revolutions of the sun and planets will be reversed, but no laws of physics are violated and nothing looks strange. The same is true for quantum mechanical examples. Let an excited atom decay and emit a photon. Run the process backwards and you have an atom absorbing light and ending in an excited state. Yet, many complex processes do display clear temporal directionality. The ruptured balloon, dangling from the tearful childs hand never spontaneously reassembles itself back into its inflated condition. Such irreversible processes like the rotting of food and the decay of teeth are in sharp contrast to the time reversible laws of physics. Our little sick friends inevitable ride down the river of time, along with our own, is full of irreversible transformations, leading to death, the one we most fear. Therefore, despite the symmetry of the fundamental interactions, nature clearly has many asymmetric and irreversible processes. As we will see below, the physicists explanation for this asymmetry, within symmetric underlying laws, can help us understand some of the deepest lessons from Middle Way Buddhism. The two decades that this little boy can look forward to seem criminally short from here, yet time may seem to crawl unendurably in his final days. However, in this digital age most believe that, despite such subjective experiences, time is absolute. Two decades is a well-defined interval that all observers can agree on, despite their subjective biases. Again, appreciating how physics destroys this apparent absoluteness can also deepen our understanding of Middle Way Buddhism. I hope to show that understanding a little about time in modern physics helps us more deeply appreciate some of the most profound ideas in Buddhism. Furthermore, I will also suggest that some appreciation of Middle Way Buddhist ideas could aid in the development of physics. Thus a nontrivial synergy between these two very different disciplines is possible, one that results in deeper understanding and more compassionate action. While time may be a devouring tiger, appreciating these ideas might help us attain equanimity and encourage us to act more compassionately toward each other and the planet. II. Carrots and Emptiness in the Middle Way Ill review the principle of emptiness within the Middle Way Consequence School (Prasangika Madhyamika, which I abbreviate by Middle Way) through a little story. Nearly thirty years ago a very holy man gave me some fresh carrot juice to drink. What a tasty elixir! I returned home determined to grow some fresh carrots of my own on our little farm. (Actually, I was determined to get my wife to grow them.) However, the soil in my part of the world is heavy and stony, and the carrots that first year were stubby and misshapen. I thought, "If only I had a garden tiller, I could whip that heavy soil into the most beautiful carrot bed." I could not afford one of those fancy tillers that a delicate ten-year-old girl can operate with one hand. My rototiller is a test of my manhood, a bucking bronco requiring strength and stamina. Of course, time destroys both people and equipment, and my tiller soon suffered from a long list of woes. It requires the patience of an advanced Bodhisattva to start, it only works at the deepest setting, it no longer has a reverse, and it cannot run in place and so bolts ahead . . . when you can manage to start it. However, I only use it a few hours a year, so I suffer with it and consider it a perverse sort of challenge. One beautiful spring day a few years ago the rototiller was taking me for my annual ride while it bathed me in the blue smoke of burning oil. I was musing on carrots and rototillers and suddenly had a tiny enlightenment. The second of Buddhas Four Noble Truths tells us that suffering is caused by desire. My desire for that delicious carrot juice had chained me to this rototiller for a quarter of a century! A desire for fresh, sweet carrot juice initially seemed innocent and "spiritually correct," in that good health is an aid to practicing dharma, but look where it led. Desire does generate suffering. However, those blue clouds bellowing from the burned out muffler along with that shattering noise and vibration urged me to deeper reflection. Upon what is that carrot-desire based? The Middle Way clearly answers that desires and aversions are based upon the false belief in independent existence, the idea that beyond my personal associations, relationship, and names for carrots, there is a real, substantial, inherently existent entity. This substantially existent object, that entity that "exists from its own side," is the basis upon which we project all our desires and aversions, all our craving for and fleeing from objects. This innate and unreflective belief in inherent existence divides into two pieces. First, that phenomena exist independent of mind or knowing. That "underneath" or "behind" the psychological associations, names, and linguistic conventions we apply to objects like carrot or rototiller, something objective and substantial exists fully and independently from its own side. Such independent objects appear to provide the objective basis for our shared world. Second, we falsely believe these objects to be self-contained and independent of each other.[2] Each object being fundamentally nonrelational, it exists on its own right without essential dependence upon other objects or phenomena. In other words, the essential nature of these objects is their nonrelational unity and completeness in themselves. Since it is so critical to identify inherent existence carefully, let me say it in other words. Consider the carrot stripped of its sense qualities, history, location, and relation to its surroundings. All but an advanced practitioner of the Middle Way believes that this denuded carrot has some unique essence, some concrete existence that provides the foundation for all its other qualities. This core of its being, this independent or inherent existence, is what the Middle Way denies. The carrot surely has conventional existence; it attracts rodents and makes great juice. It functions as a food. However, it totally lacks independent or inherent existence, what we falsely believe is the core of its being. In other words, the object or subject we falsely believe independently exists is not actually "finable upon analysis." When we search diligently for that entity we believe inherently exists, we cannot actually find it. Its independent being does not become clearer and more definite upon searching. Instead, phenomena exist in the middle way because they lack inherent existence, but do have conventional existence. While reifying carrots, I simultaneously reify the one who desires carrots and consider him as inherently existent too. Out of the seamless flux of experience, I falsely impute or attribute inherent existence to both the subject and its object of desire and thereby spin the wheel of samsara. In this way, perception is a double act that simultaneously generates a false belief in inherently existent subjects and objects, gentleman farmers and their carrots. Then our time is occupied with cherishing our personal ego, putting its desires before all else, pushing others aside to satisfy those desires, and running after objects we falsely believe inherently exist. We think those objects will make us happy, but in fact they can never satisfy us. Perhaps time "is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire." Was not this the point of the Buddhas fire sermon? According to the Middle Way, we can put out the fire by deeply appreciating the doctrine of emptiness, the lack of inherent existence in all subjects and objects, in all phenomena. This requires not only an intellectual formulation as given here, but a profound transformation of our whole being at many levelsa process that usually takes many life times. Just so that you will have the whole story, I recently bought a new tractor to replace my 1934 hand-cranking model (also the source of many deep lessons). With the new tractor, I bought a huge rototiller that attaches to it and makes garden preparation a breeze. However, I have given the old rototiller, now called the dharma-tiller, to my son hoping that he will grow good vegetables and a deeper understanding of emptiness. The description of emptiness given so far is negative, a thoroughgoing denial of what we wrongly believe is the core of existence. Next, let me turn to a more positive description of phenomena, including carrots. If phenomena dont independently exist than how do they exist? The Middle Way tells us that they dependently exist in three fundamental ways. First, phenomena exist dependent upon causes and conditions. For example, carrots depend upon soil, sunlight, moisture, freedom from rodents, and so forth. Second, phenomena depend upon the whole and its parts. Carrots depend upon its greens, stem, root hairs, and so on and the totality of all these parts. Third, and most profoundly, phenomena depend upon mental imputation, attribution, or designation. From the rich panoply of experience, I collect the sense qualities, personal associations, and psychological reactions to carrots together, and name them or designate them as "carrot." The minds proper functioning is to construct its world, the only world we can know. The error enters because along with naming comes the false attribution of inherent existence, that foundation for desire and aversion. For the Middle Way, dependent arising is a complementary way of describing emptiness. We can understand them as two different views of the same truth. Therefore, contrary to our untutored beliefs, the ultimate nature of phenomena is its dependency and relatedness, not isolated existence and independence. One of the difficulties in understanding emptiness is that we can easily assent to the importance of relatedness, while falling prey to the unconscious assumption that relations are superimposed upon independently existent terms in the relation. In fact, it is the relationships, the interdependencies that are the reality, since objects or subjects are nothing but their connections to other objects and subjects. We might ask what would phenomena be like if they did in fact inherently or independently exist. The Middle Way explains that inherently existent objects would be immutable, since in their essence they are independent of other phenomena and so uninfluenced by any interactions. Conversely, independently existent objects would also be unable to influence other phenomena, since they are complete and self-contained. In short, independently existent objects would be immutable and impotent. Of course, experience denies this since our world is of continuously interacting phenomena, from the growth of carrots nourished by sun, rain, and soil, to their destruction by rodents. From the subjective side, that we do not independently exist implies that it is possible to transform ourselves into Buddhas, exemplars of infinite wisdom and compassion. Critics of the Middle Way often say that if objects did not inherently exist, they could not function to produce help and harm. Carrots lacking independent existence could not give sweet juice or make soup. The Middle Way turns this around 180 degrees, and answers that it is precisely because objects and subjects lack independent existence that they are capable of functioning. So the very attribute that we falsely believe is at the core of phenomena would, if present, actually prevent them from functioning. Now how does all this relate to the Middle Way notion of time? As I mentioned above, if phenomena inherently existed then they would of necessity be immutable and impotent, unable to act on us or we on them. Since, in truth, phenomena are fundamentally a shifting set of dependency relations, impermanence and change are built into them at the most fundamental level. That the carrot exists in dependence upon causes and conditions, its whole and parts, and on our attribution or naming is what makes it edible, allows me to experience it and be nourished by it. More important for impermanence, these defining relations and co-dependencies and their continuously shifting connections with each other guarantee that all objects and subjects are impermanent, ceaselessly evolving, maturing, and decaying. In short, emptiness and impermanence are two sides of the coin of existence and therefore transformation and change are built into the core of all entities, both subjective and objective. In this way, the doctrine of impermanence is a direct expression of emptiness/dependent arising. Because I lack inherent existence and am most fundamentally a kinetic set of shifting experiences, with no eternal soul, as we normally understand it, then "Time is the substance I am made of." Borges compact sentence seems like a Middle Way aphorism. Being substantially of time guarantees my continuous transformation and death. Indeed, time "is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire." These philosophic truths of emptiness and impermanence are central to Buddhist practice, and I return to them later. Now let us turn to physics and its view of time. III. Time in Modern Physics As mentioned in the introduction, we all have a natural belief in the absoluteness of time, meaning that, for example, one minute is the same for all observers. Let me again proceed by way of example. My carrots take 70 days to harvest time. Our belief in the absoluteness of time or its independent existence appears in the view that this time is something intrinsic to the carrot. As long as the growing conditions are normal, it does not matter how this time is measured or who measures it. It has an independent or absolute nature. However, let an astronaut take the same seeds and grow them in a space ship traveling at 90 percent the speed of light relative to the Earth. Then relativity theory tells us that the days to harvest (as measured by an Earth-based observer) would be 161 days.[3] Figure 1 shows the days to harvest, as observed on Earth, plotted against the velocity of the space ship, relative to Earth, divided by the speed of light, c. So for example when v/c = .9 then we move straight upward from that point on the horizontal axis and intersect the curve at 161 days. Only in a reference frame at rest with respect to the observer (the rest frame) is the days to harvest 70 days. ------------------- Figure 1-------------------- Relativity emphatically states that no value of the days to harvest time is any more real or intrinsic than any other. For example, if the astronaut looked back at my garden she would correctly measure my time to harvest as 161 days. Since time intervals depend directly upon the relationship between the object and the observer, they are essentially relational. We cannot consider time independent of a particular reference frame. In Middle Way language, it lacks independent existence. If the seed manufacturers were devotees of relativity they would state on the package, "The time to harvest is 70 day only in the rest frame. For other reference frames consult the graph on the back." That graph would be Figure 1. We can attempt to evade this relational nature of time by saying that humans never travel at any significant fraction of the speed of light, and so this is just an academic consideration. This move denies the conceptual import of relativitys view of time and the thousands of experiments done all over the planet every day that rely on it. If we clarify the idea of the present moment, the essentially relational nature of time intervals, whether decades or microseconds, is complemented by a thoroughgoing relativity of the present. Take the reasonable definition that all the simultaneous events that take place for an observer at one time defines the present moment. Lets say I plant my carrots at exactly 9:00 AM on a given day and at that moment a friend in New Deli boards a plane, while my son enters a classroom in a distant city. Relativity teaches that those simultaneous events defining the moment of carrot planting are only simultaneous in my gardens reference frame. If our farmer-astronaut, moving at 90 percent the speed of light, passes directly over my garden at 9:00 AM he observers a different set of simultaneous events and thus his present moment differs from mine. While a second astronaut, traveling at a different speed over my garden at 9:00 AM, finds yet a third set of simultaneous events and thus a different present from mine or the first astronaut. Therefore, relativity makes both time intervals and individual moments relative to a given reference frame, leaving our old absolute view of time far behind. There are similar things to say about other primary qualities of objects, but these points about time are enough for the present. A more interesting and profound quality of time comes from understanding how it has an arrow. We store our carrots in the cellar where there is a cool, even temperature. However, even there, they rot after four to six months. We have never seen rotten food return to its fresh state. Rotting, whether of vegetables, teeth, or our entire bodies, is an irreversible process. Given that the quantum mechanical laws, which govern the chemical changes of rotting, are time symmetric, this is mysterious. The great Austrian physicist, Ludwig Boltzmann, made the first significant progress in understanding this mystery. He realized that irreversibility comes from reversible underlying laws only when you have large numbers of particles in the system. Boltzmann started by considering a simple box containing many gas particles governed by Newtons laws. In analyzing this system, he assumed that it was totally isolated from the rest of the universe. There were no influences of the universe on the box and its contents or vice versa. Now this should give anybody influenced by the Middle Way philosophy some real discomfort, since he is assuming that the system independently exists. More about that later. Boltzmann then imagined a partition in the middle of the box with all the particles in just one half of the box. The other half is totally empty. To proceed further we need to understand the concept of entropy, or measure of disorder. The more disorder, the less knowledge we have about the details of the system, the higher the entropy. When the partition is removed, the overwhelmingly most probable configurations of the new equilibrium condition involve the gas spreading evenly throughout the box. In principle, it is possible for the gas to bunch up in only one quarter of the box. However, it is overwhelmingly more probable that it will attain a new equilibrium configuration diffused throughout the box. Such equilibrium states have maximum entropy. Through this reasoning, Boltzmann proved the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that any isolated systems entropy must either stay the same or increase. Therefore, when the egg hits the floor it is overwhelmingly likely to go to a state of greater entropy. What is more, the increase in entropy defines the direction of the arrow of time. Time advances in the same direction in which entropy increaseswhat we call the future. This does not deny that there are local decreases in entropy, like the growth of a child, but the global entropy relentlessly increases with time. For several years, I taught our junior-senior level course on statistical physics. We used the standard textbook and followed Boltzmanns derivation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, with the appropriate level of mathematical sophistication. In the last few years, I found that there were arguments as far back as 1877 that showed Boltzmann was deeply wrong. I review some of these problems elsewhere in nontechnical language..[4] Here, I take a different approach and follow an elegant and simple argument by P.C.W. Davies.[5] As we will shortly see, entropy increases, but not the way Boltzmann thought. Why several revisions of this famous text persist in the error is a mystery. ------------- Figure 2 --------------- The basic difficulty, which can be seen in several independent ways, is that completely isolated systems, like the box of gas, can generate no directionality to time because of the time-symmetric laws governing the system. Figure 2 displays the entropy, S, of an isolated box of gas plotted versus time, t. We see that the random gas motions give occasional deviations below the maximum. Although it is unlikely, the random motions spontaneously generate states of greater order or lower entropy, which are then brought back to maximum disorder by the same randomization. This is like the shuffling of playing cards that, on rare occasions, puts them into states of greater order, with continued shuffling returning them to disorder. ---------------- Figure 3 ---------------- Now imagine the following experiment illustrated in Figure 3. We just patiently monitor the system until its entropy spontaneously drops to the value S 1 or below at a time t 1 . If we choose S 1 low enough, this could take a long time. The virtue of choosing a small value of S 1 is that once it occurs, we know we are very likely to be near the bottom of a dip in the entropy curve, rather then part way down a larger dip. This is simply because the even larger dips are so much less likely. At t 1, when the low entropy, S 1 , occurs, since we are very likely at the minimum of a dip, an increase in entropy with time happens in either direction. At time t 1 + e , where e is some small time interval, the entropy increases. We consider this the future. However, the entropy also increases in the past at t 1 - e . Therefore, the symmetry of the underlying laws of physics gives no directionality to entropy increase or time. Even before I began getting instruction from my rototiller 25 years ago, the problem of the arrow of time had largely been resolved, although there are still technical subtleties. Much to the delight of the Middle Way, the main problem lies in assuming we have a totally isolated system independent of interaction with its environment. We now understand that we must account for how Boltzmanns box got into the low entropy state of all particles in just one half. This did not result from just waiting a long time for random motions to throw the gas all to one side, but from Boltzmann evacuating one half and placing gas in the other. Preparing the box in a low entropy state must generate more entropy elsewhere in the universe. For example, Boltzmann consumed calories from lunch and radiated energy from himself and his equipment that eventually went into deep space. In other words, the box had its entropy put into a low condition by processes outside itself, but at the expense of a much greater entropy increase elsewhere in the universe. Let me give an example closer to the garden. I walk in the garden to check on whether the mice have eaten the carrots. My footprint in the soft soil gives it more order and structure, thus lowering its entropy. However, this lower entropy comes from a much greater generation of entropy from my metabolic processes, which eventually degrade to heat radiated to the universe. As we have long known, the energy emitted into deep space from our activities can only radiate into space because the universe is expanding. If the universe were not expanding then it is so large that any line of sight from the Earth, when extended far enough, would land on a star surface. Then the effective temperature of deep space would be that of the surface of stars, which is typically 6000 °K, rather than the 3 °K it actually has. Since entropy can only increase when energy moves from high to low temperature regions, the simple process of radiating our body's energy into space would be blocked in a static universe. Thus, there would be neither a Boltzmann nor the ability to reduce entropy locally in the box by generating more entropy elsewhere in the universe. All systems organizing themselves or decreasing their entropy, whether the growing of a carrot, a snowflake, or a child, are decreasing entropy in one location that must be accompanied by a greater entropy generation in another. Not only is the energy from Boltzmanns food and his equipment eventually traced back to our sun, but the suns low entropy is critical. Energy generation processes, whether the digestion of our food or the workings of a nuclear power plant, are totally dependent upon our solar system being in a low entropy condition. What causes the sun and other stars to be in a low entropy condition? This occurs because the expansion of the universe was faster than the nuclear generation rates in the first three minutes of the big bang. Then, when nearly all the helium (about 25% of the total mass of the universe) was formed, the universe expanded so quickly that after three minutes it was too cool for nuclear reactions to occur. If the expansion and associated cooling were much slower, then all the matter in the universe would form into a very stable isotope of iron, an inert and high entropy condition. Then the stars would not shine, there would be no great entropy gradients in the universe, no time asymmetry, and, of course, no life. Local time-asymmetry, such as the decay of any biological system, from carrots to our own bodies, must be accounted for by connecting it to the expansion of the universe and its earliest evolution. This extraordinary beautiful result has many technical twists and turns, but the central idea is clear: increasing entropy and time-asymmetry owe their existence to the largest and earliest processes in the universe and its continued expansion. This is a long way from the notion of an isolated and noninteracting system, so abhorrent to the Middle Way. In this way, when you put cold milk into your coffee and the mixture comes to the same temperature and a higher entropy than when the fluids were separated, you are profiting from the universes expanding and cooling before iron-56 could form. Similarly, that we must all face the irreversible process of death, with its massive entropy increase, is traceable to the earliest and largest processes in the universe. In other words, the impermanence and decay found all around us is due to the earliest and most distance process in the universe and its continued expansion. On a more positive note, irreversible processes are also essential to life. If metabolic processes did not irreversibly transform my lunch, not only would I get indigestion, I would not live. That which sustains me also destroys me. Indeed, time "is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire." IV. Comparisons and Connections As I have said in my recent ruminations[6] about the relationship between physics and Buddhism, it is a mistake to connect any Buddhist principle too closely with any particular phenomena from physics. Physical theories are prime examples of impermanence. What happens if I make an argument that some physical effect verifies some great principle of Buddhism and then the physics is replaced by a new theory? Does that damage Buddhism? Are the foundations of Buddhism to tremble at every scientific revolution? A more fruitful dialogue between Buddhism and science can occur when comparisons and connections are done at a more philosophic level. For example, here I have tried to focus on emptiness, the philosophic heart of Buddhism, and make connections with questions of comparable philosophic significance in physics. If the connections mutually illuminate both the physics and the Buddhism, without trying to reduce one to the other, then our understanding of both disciplines deepens. In the present example, the erroneous assumption of a thermodynamic system being completely isolated from any form of external interaction was a critical error. This error could have been avoided if the philosophic principle of emptiness were more widely understood and appreciated in the scientific community. Physics is always done in a philosophic context. In the case of classical statistical physics and thermodynamics, it was done within Cartesian dualism. Although Descartes vision helped both physics and western philosophy, it has also hindered us in more ways than we can count. I suggest that the principle of emptiness, if more fully appreciated within science, could actually further the scientific enterprise. What does Buddhism gain from such connections and comparisons as attempted here? I see at least two benefits. First, understanding such things as the relativity of time (the 70 days to harvest example) and the relativity of the present moment helps us appreciate the closely parallel arguments made in the Middle Way about times lack of inherent existence. There is a well-known and difficult section in Nagarjunas Mulamadhyamakakarika that analyzes time and leads to the modern interpretation, "Time is thus merely a dependent set of relations, not an entity in its own right, and certainly not the inherently existent vessel of existence it might appear to be."[7] Such critical, but difficult, points are illuminated by understanding Einsteins relativity of time. In short, science can help us understand ancient, but pivotal, philosophic aspects of Buddhism. Second, Buddhism is a portable religion that has wandered far from the home of the original Prince. In each movement, whether to China, Japan, or Cambodia, it takes on the hues of the local culture without losing its original spiritual impulse. Science is clearly a cultural dominant in the West. Therefore, if Buddhism is to come to the West, in the best and fullest sense of the term, then interaction with science is both inevitable and necessary for a real transplant to take place. The present effort at understanding some common ground and even synergy between Buddhism and science can be part of the effort to translate Buddhism into terms that are easier for a Westerner to assimilate. V. Summary and Conclusions Reflecting on the relativity of time and how the irreversible nature of my little friends disease connects to the first few minutes of the universe and its continued expansion gives me little comfort. Yes, intellectually these ideas strongly support the principle of emptiness, that both the mother and the little boy along with the one who writes these words lack independent existence. Yes, we are all a system of interdependent relations and thereby subject to the law of impermanence. Nevertheless, the heartache remains. That little boy will be consumed by the "fire of time" before he reaches the age of my two sons. According to the Middle Way, my inveterate projection of that false quality of independent existence is the foundation for my attachment and consequent suffering. It all comes back to my inability to put these ideas fully into practice. This is often the plight of those who can articulate ideas but not fully live them. Or being kinder to myself, perhaps I have assimilated just enough of the principle of emptiness to give me a deep appreciation of the mothers sorrow, but not enough to dispassionately see it all as an embodiment of the First Noble Truth, that all experience is suffused with suffering. What then do we do? The Middle Way advises us to take refuge in the Three Jewels: the Buddha or fully enlightened One, the Buddhas teaching, and the community of those seeking enlightenment. The Buddha shows that we can do it. We suffering humans, nurtured and destroyed by time, can become full embodiments of wisdom and compassion and break free from the suffering of samsara, the endless torment of repeated death and rebirth. The Buddhas teaching, which includes emptiness and much more, is the work at hand among those who support our efforts at realizing these great truthsincluding the mother and her sick child. If I could reflect deeply enough on the relativity of the twenty years as the maximum allotted to this child and that the very irreversibility of his condition, and my own, is due to deep cosmological connections, then perhaps my sense of connectedness to others and the cosmos could increase. Could I realize more deeply that my ego and yours are dependent, not inherently existent, but fundamentally co-dependent systems of relationships? Could I profoundly appreciate that there is no speaker without a listener, no griever without a dependently related object of grief? If I could, then the centrality of my own ego and my self-cherishing would surely diminish. Such a realization of my egos emptiness and our mutual co-dependency must result in compassion, not just for this little boy and his mother, but for all sentient beings. Assimilating these great truths and shifting my ego off center stage is surely not easy, but the promised increase in understanding and compassion keeps me trying. If I could deeply appreciate that any irreversible process, whether the rotting of carrots or my body, is due to the earliest and largest scale structure of the cosmos, then how much easier it would be to appreciate that my neighbors loss or gain is not separate from mine. Then the suffering in one cell of the body of humanity is truly the suffering of all. Perhaps, we could even realize that compassion is actually in our own enlightened self-interest and that the survival of our very planet requires a profound understanding of our co-dependence. In contrast, we could ask what happens when our philosophic view embraces the false notion of independent existence. The late David Bohm, known for both the depths of his physics and philosophy, said it very directly when he wrote: It is proposed that the widespread and pervasive distinctions between people (race, nation, family, profession, etc., etc.), which are now preventing mankind from working together for the common good, and indeed, even for survival, have one of the key factors of their origin in a kind of thought that treats things as inherently divided, disconnected, and "broken up" into yet smaller constituent parts. Each part is considered to be essentially independent and self-existent.[8] According to Bohm, many of the evils of our modern world are traceable to a view where "Each part is considered to be essentially independent and self-existent." In other words, one in which things inherently exist. I tried to show above that, although we commonly assume for simplicity that a system, such as Boltzmanns box, is independent from its surroundings, such a view misleads us. This is bad enough in physics, but when a race, nation, or person views themselves as fundamentally independent, then the stage is set for calamitythe stuff of our daily headlines. As we stand on the threshold of ever more powerful theories in science, it is more urgent then ever that we find a coherent world view that can guide our science as well as our moral actions. Consider how the advent of quantum mechanics and relativity brought about the wonders of the information age, along with our horrendous weapons of mass destruction. Then imagine what wonders and horrors might be released by a grand unified theory or "theory of everything" that today occupies some of the best minds in physics. What benefits and horrors can we expect from the revolution already underway to understand the complete genetic code? Ill conclude with one small example. Despite it not being "spiritually correct," I enjoy watching professional football on TV. I usually hope for a close game with plenty of action. Occasionally, I find myself rooting for one team. I urge them on to victory, and even try to exert mental influence through my TV set. I catch myself and wonder what I am doing. "Hey, these guys are getting millions of dollars to beat each other up, what do I care who wins?" After a little reflection, I realize that "my teams" are those I have some connection with, even it if is only because they are from the State of New York or I go through the Pittsburgh airport on most of my flights. These flimsiest of connections give me affection and concern for those gladiators. What would happen if I could more deeply appreciate the profound interdependence implied by the Middle Way? What would happen if I could more deeply appreciate, as more than interesting physics, how the irreversible processes that sustain and destroy my life occur because of my connection to the first few minutes of the big bang and the continuing expansion of the universe? Then how much do my loyalties expand? If I could appreciate that the relativity of time is logically extended to all my subjectivity, then how could I rationally support my selfishness and self-cherishing? It is overwhelming to think about extending my loyalties beyond a small circle of family and friends to the cosmos. Now that we know of more planets outside our solar system than within, does the Bodhisattva vow of working for the liberation of all sentient beings, embrace even those beyond our solar systems? Surely, experiencing the sadness of more parents and their mortally sick children would crush me. How then can I possibly cultivate compassion on a cosmological scale? Perhaps the ecological activists can offer guidance. In the face of daunting global ecological problems, they advise us to "think globally and act locally." Following their counsel, I try to keep the cosmological picture in mind and simultaneously act in the present with the person in front of me. Then it seems small ripples of compassionate action gradually flood beyond my little circle of family and close friends. The ideal is to extend our concern out in ever widening radii, until it encompasses more and more of the great suffering body of humanity. If in fact, I lack inherent existence then my present limitations are not fixed, in place for eternity, and I can work toward this ideal. Let us begin to widen the circle of concern beyond the narrow confines of "our team" and "our friends." How else can we live with that devouring tiger of time, that inexorably includes our final irreversible process? Acknowledgments It is a pleasure to thank Professor B.

The figures come loaded with articulation, with over 30 points to pose and tweak to your liking. Both Jax and Clay are around 12 inches tall and feature uncanny likeness to both Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman. Jax includes 6 interchangeable hands, including one with a cigar and one with a knife. He also comes with a pair of sunglasses, a Heckler and Koch USP Expert, a combat knife, wallet with chain, and a display stand. The exclusive version comes with 11 total accessories, including more weapons like a Glock 17 and a Tek-9.In an effort to dispel perceptions that he's a radical right-winger, David Koch told Barbara Walters in December that he's "basically a libertarian," explaining that he's "a conservative on economic matters, and I’m a social liberal.” Koch's comments hardly came as a surprise. Before he and his brother Charles calculated that they could best implement their anti-government agenda as Republican megadonors, David was the Libertarian Party's vice presidential nominee in 1980. Moreover, "socially liberal, fiscally conservative" politics are pretty much the norm among the corporate elite. They don't get exercised over abortion and gay marriage; in fact, they're often downright embarrassed by the troglodytic views of rank-and-file social conservatives. What really matters is that they're allowed to profit (and plunder) as they please, free from the overweening hand of the nefarious state.

Published under a Creative Commons License.NEW DELHI: In a city where 19% murders take place for the most frivolous of reasons, here’s one that has left even the police aghast.A porter at New Delhi railway station was arrested for murdering a monkey handler in the early hours of Independence Day inside the station premises because, according to him, “monkeys have the right to drink wine”. The monkey handler, Irfan(26)—from Seemapuri in northeast Delhi, had asked Ram Babu(36) alias Gochu Pehelwan not to offer liquor to his animals and warned him “not to test his patience”.“On the night of August 14, Ram Babu was near the Ajmeri Gate area looking for alcohol. When Irfan arrived there with his two monkeys, the two decided to have drinks together. After a while, Ram Babu started serving liquor to Irfan’s monkeys. Irfan objected and a scuffle broke out during which Ram Babu hit him on the head with a brick, then panicked and ran away,” DCP (railways) Sanjay Bhatia said.Local sources told the cops that Irfan was seen in the area with two monkeys. Accordingly, all localities where monkey handlers reside were searched. “On August 15, at 5.50am, Irfan was found unconscious near the Ajmeri Gate entrance of New Delhi station. He was rushed to Lok Nayak Hospital where he succumbed to head injuries. Bricks stained with blood were found from the spot,” Bhatia added.According to Delhi Police, many murders in the past have happened due to frivolous reasons like failure to spot the route number of a DTC bus, not returning Rs 5, urinating in a neighbour’s toilet and refusing a minor a smoke. “An analysis of motives behind the murders this year reveals that 7% resulted from enmity and 10% driven by passion,” a senior police officer said.Six per cent of the murders were due to old enmity while 3% were due to property or monetary disputes.The topic of my Sloan project came about very organically. As soon as I decided to apply for the grant, I knew it was going to involve forensics. Then I asked myself, "What's the most common tool people associate with criminal investigation?" The answer was obvious: fingerprints.
Mr. Huckabee, Please don’t form a third party! With the support of Evangelicals combined with the moderate Republicans (along with some obscene gerrymandering) the GOP managed to only get curb-stomped in the last election while keeping power in local governments. If you split the party, dividing the votes, anything could happen. It could mean the death of gay marriage for centuries! Clearly, what has been weighing the GOP down have been the ideologically impure. Remember when you said that god didn’t protect the Sandy Hook students because we don’t pray in schools? Well, this is kind of the same way. Most atheists like me have thought for a long time that the GOP better not ditch the moderates, whose opinions are less offensive to the opinions of voters than yours, lest god override the free will of American voters to put the Evangelicals into power. For the sake of our secular nation, please do not do this! Do anything else! Tie me down and stream Justin Bieber’s discography straight into my brain while Ray Comfort lectures me. Any fate would be less terrifying than Evangelicals splitting the Republican vote! Believe me when I say that there is nothing atheists would hate more than Evangelicals forming a third party, aside from you throwing us into that briar patch. So sincerely, JT
Just recently, in 2014, a 20th anniversary passed of another rebellion, profoudly similar to that of Rojava . Indigenous people challenged the state power and put self-organized “Juntas de Buen Gobierno” in action. Neither anarchist nor marxist, rejecting all traditional political affiliations. Fighting against the state and corporations in perhaps a bit less geopolitically critical area – Mexican Chiapas. NeoZapastistas. EZLN . It is not about the similarities (they even brought as much controversies within radical circles as Rojava did), but about the way they managed to survive and stay integral over 20 years of struggle against the state and capitalism: their worldwide social support. By the wide popular involvement, by creative and intense use of new media, they gained upper hand in the “social net war” and made themselves safe against most brutal assaults. There is still a covert war going against them, but no open attack goes unnoticed. And, in the Americas, NeoZapatistas became a benchmark, a “center of competence” for non-state radical left projects. Not by force, but by swift inteligence and world-wide supporting movement they won. In the beginning, they were just a bit suspicious, tribal-nationalist movement of uncertain political provenience. Now, after 20 years supporting EZLN is a risk-free investment. How come?
Symmes, however, was not the first to argue that the Earth was hollow; nor is Symzonia the first novel set in a hollow earth. There are of course numerous narratives – dating back to Greek and Roman texts – of descents into the underworld, but hypotheses about vast channels or chasms inside the Earth appear to be a much more recent idea advanced by some European thinkers in the 17th and 18th centuries as an explanation of volcanoes, whirlpools and the like. This period is filled with a variety of now discarded cosmological hypotheses, many inspired by the attempt to reconcile scriptural accounts of Creation with scientific observation: hypotheses about the movement of the sun, the earth and the stars, about the universality of the great Flood, about creation and the origins of life, and about the earth’s own formation. Among the proponents of now abandoned theories about the composition of our planet was Edmond Halley (better known for the comet which bears his name), who proposed (in a paper explaining the movement of the magnetic poles published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1692) that the earth was hollow: “that the seemingly solid earth is actually a shell about 500 miles thick containing three smaller concentric spheres… each sphere separated from the others by about 500 miles of atmosphere.”
While it is perhaps relatively easy to follow the theories of inner cavities or of a passage between the poles (in writers like Thomas Burnet and Athanasius Kircher in the late 17th century), and to see their relationship to a text like the anonymous 1721 Relation D’Un Voyage Du Pole Arctique Au Pole Antarctique Par Le Centre Du Monde, (which describes a channel running through the Earth from pole to pole), it is much more difficult to understand how the idea of the hollow Earth emerged as part of Halley’s explanation of the motion of the magnetic poles. Even more inexplicable is the depiction of the hollow earth some fifty years earlier – complete with inner sun and earth – in Ludvig Holberg’s 1741 subterranean utopia, The Journey of Niels Klim to the World Underground. This is a far greater imaginative leap, for instance, than Jules Verne’s well-known account of a descent into the bowels of the earth through a dormant volcano (Voyage au centre de la terre, 1865). Verne’s narrative of the discovery of a vast underworld cavern formed during an earlier geological period seems much more plausible than Holberg’s invention of two entire inner worlds – one a planet inhabited by intelligent trees, the other the underside of the earth’s crust, as vast as the outer crust on which we live, and populated with a fantastic variety of intelligent life forms.
Born in Bergen, Norway at the time of the Dano-Norwegian monarchy, Ludvig Holberg (1684–1754) is probably the most European of Scandinavian writers before Ibsen and certainly the best known; he is often referred to as the “father” of Danish and Norwegian literature. He was a writer, essayist, philosopher, historian and playwright who travelled extensively throughout Europe and is often credited as bringing the Enlightenment to the Nordic countries. In fact, the author of The Journey of Niels Klim was far better known for his “Introduction to Natural and International Law“ and his theatre (he has been described as the “Moliere of the North”). Like Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), Klim is a combination of social satire, utopia and the fantastic. But Swift’s shipwrecked narrator is a much more familiar (and plausible) utopian narrative device than is Holberg’s imagination of a hollow earth. Holberg never explains who “those men … who hold the Earth to be hollow” are, and none of his critics have been able to identify them. As long as Holberg’s sources continue to be a mystery, The Journey of Niels Klim to the World Underground must be considered the first presentation of the idea of the hollow earth.
As news of the incident spread across social media, concerned students and residents rallied behind the women. But that support wavered once University and local law enforcement officials began suggesting the racial element of the attack was entirely fabricated. With the racial component called into question, many members of the community saw the Black women as the instigators of the altercation. News outlets helped further the narrative that race was not a factor, and the incident was quickly labeled a hoax. Eventually, all three women were expelled from school and formally charged for their involvement in the brawl. Additional charges were levied against the women for falsely reporting the incident to 911, causing “public alarm and inconvenience,” and prompting an undue “expenditure of resources.” MORE: Fake hate: SUNY students who alleged racial attack are charged themselves If race did play a significant role in the UAlbany Bus Incident, it can be argued that all charges stemming from falsely reporting the altercation are questionable at best. Additionally, given the well-documented culture of violence at UAlbany, the swift and severe consequences enacted by the University in response to this incident may be deemed inconsistent with their history of tolerating dangerous student misconduct. Indefensible examines the ways both race and racism are viewed through competing lenses in society, and how dismissing the narratives of the most marginalized can perpetuate existing systems of oppression. It attempts to highlight the inherent problems in allowing the benefactors of racism to define and legitimize what constitutes a racially motivated act. Indefensible also looks at the intersections of oppression causing Black women in particular to be regarded as untrustworthy and undeserving of defense.
This one is from a week ago, and a bunch of you submitted it (though Tim K gets the hat tip for being first), but just getting around to it now. Apparently, a woman named Paula Asher, who hit a car while driving under the influence, was ordered by the judge in the case to delete her Facebook account , after she typed the following status message on her Facebook page:The judge seemed to take the "LOL" statement literally -- that she was "laughing out loud" at her drunk driving accident -- and ordered her to delete her Facebook account. She then ignored that order, leading to a contempt of court charge and jail time. I have no problem with her facing punishment for the drunk driving, but being told to delete her Facebook page seems extreme on a variety of levels. First, the literal interpretation of "LOL" is a bit unfair, considering in context how many people use the term today. Rather than literally meaning that they're "laughing out loud," it's often an expression of exasperation at a situation people find themselves in. Many people seem to use it more asto a statement they make, rather than as an accurate description of what they're doing.But, even beyond that, it seems wrong to order the deletion of an entire Facebook account over one off-hand statement like that. Facebook had nothing to do with this woman's drunk driving -- which, again, she should be punished for. I could even see reason to up the level of punishment for potentially showing a lack of remorse or recognition of the seriousness of her crime. But forcing someone to delete their entire Facebook account, when it's a key way that many people communicate today, seems extreme. Facebook didn't make Asher drive drunk. Nor did it make her not show remorse afterward. Forcing her to shut it down completely seems to go beyond reasonable.
During his third and final voyage, Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii.[96] After his initial landfall in January 1778 at Waimea harbor, Kauai, Cook named the archipelago the "Sandwich Islands" after the fourth Earl of Sandwich—the acting First Lord of the Admiralty of the British Royal Navy.[97] Captain James Cook's last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. After having arrived in the Hawaiian islands in 1778, Captain Cook sailed north and then northeast to explore the west coast of North America north of the Spanish settlements in Alta California. He made landfall on the Oregon coast at approximately 44°30′ north latitude, naming his landing point Cape Foulweather. Bad weather forced his ships south to about 43° north before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward.[98] In March 1778, Cook landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet "King George's Sound". He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a place you can "go around"). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives' autonym (a name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook's mispronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.[99] He returned to Hawaii to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island, trading with locals and then making anchor at Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. When his ships and company left the islands, a ship's mast broke in bad weather, forcing them to return in mid-February. Cook would be killed days later.[100] [i][j]
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the country's population to be 327,167,434 as of July 1, 2018, and to be adding 1 person (net gain) every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day.[32] The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000.[263] The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India, the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected.[264] In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children; by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56.[265] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76 children per woman in 2017.[266] Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 40 million in 2010, representing one-third of the population increase.[267] The foreign-born population reached 45 million in 2015.[268] The United States has a very diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[269] German Americans are the largest ethnic group (more than 50 million) – followed by Irish Americans (circa 37 million), Mexican Americans (circa 31 million) and English Americans (circa 28 million).[270][271]
The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average.[286] Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7%, higher than that of many developed nations.[287] In fiscal year 2016, over one million immigrants (most of whom entered through family reunification) were granted legal residence.[288] Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act. China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries every year since the 1990s.[289] As of 2012 , approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants.[290] As of 2015 , 47% of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26% are Asian, 18% are white and 8% are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing.[268] The estimated number of illegal immigrants dropped to 10.7 million in 2017, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In 2017, 33,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. This was fewer than were resettled in the rest of the world for the first time in decades.[291] A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5% of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1% of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9% of men.[292] The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia (10%), while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7%.[293]
Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%,[330] and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population.[330] Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others.[330] Two-thirds of American Protestants consider themselves to be born again.[330] Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas, as well as in the English colony of Maryland.[331] It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Catholics, with 40 percent of the total population.[332] Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion of the majority of the population.[333] The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.[334] Eastern Orthodoxy is claimed by 5% of people in Alaska,[335] a former Russian colony, and maintains a presence on the U.S. mainland due to recent immigration from Eastern Europe. Finally, a number of other Christian groups are active across the country, including the Oneness Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Restorationists, Churches of Christ, Christian Scientists, Unitarians and many others.
The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[497] At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults.[498] In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997.[499] The prison population has quadrupled since 1980,[500] and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period.[501] However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013[502] and the rate for pre-trial/remand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012.[503] The country's high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies.[504] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[505] The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate.[506][507] In 2018, Oklahoma had the highest incarceration rate (1,079 per 100,000 people), and Massachusetts the lowest (324 per 100,000 people).[508][509] Among the U.S. territories, the highest incarceration rate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands (542 per 100,000 people) and the lowest was in Puerto Rico (313 per 100,000 people).[510][511]
After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[579] There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s.[580] However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance.[581] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[582] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[583] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation. This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system.[584] The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.[585] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[587][588]

DiStefano DATE: April 15, 2010 SUBJECT: The 420 gathering at CU-Boulder on April 20, 2010 Dear CU student: As another April 20 approaches, we again are faced with concerns from students, faculty, staff, parents, alumni, regents and community members about the 420 gathering on the CU-Boulder campus. As we said last year, we share these concerns. An unsponsored gathering of thousands in the heart of our campus for the sole purpose of engaging in what is still unlawful activity is not only contrary to what we stand for as a university, it is a public safety challenge of the first order. With this in mind, on April 20, 2010, please do not participate in unlawful activity that devalues the reputation of your university and degree. At the same time, encourage your fellow Buffs to act with pride and remember who they really are - part of a dynamic environment of teaching, research, learning, and service composed of outstanding faculty and proud students and alumni. Be advised that on April 20 the following safety parameters will be enforced: -Obey the instructions of public safety officials at all times in entering and leaving campus, and act with concern for those around you, discouraging dangerous behavior of any kind. -Parking limitations similar to those during CU home football games will be enforced. Parking on campus will be greatly limited, available only at meters or for those holding CU parking permits. Traffic barricades will be set up at Colorado Avenue and Folsom Street and on 18th Street to limit traffic in the heart of campus. Please observe all parking regulations within the City of Boulder. -While police will be present on the Norlin Quad to support crowd safety, individuals found using marijuana on their way to or from the 420 gathering, or in other locations on campus, face a citation from CUPD. Likewise, no alcohol will be permitted on the Norlin Quad or elsewhere on campus, and intoxicated persons could be taken into custody or escorted to an alcohol recovery center, or both. -CU students who violate the alcohol or drug provisions of the CU Code of Conduct in the ways described above, or in other ways, are also subject to penalties from CU-Boulder's Office of Judicial Affairs. At the Norlin Quad, no vending of any merchandise or food will be permitted. No buying and selling of marijuana will be allowed. No barbecue grills, structures, slacklines, sporting or game apparatus, or large signs may be erected. We want to re-emphasize that our intention in this communication is safety. This is an unsanctioned event on our campus, but regardless, we all desire it be carried out with no injuries to individuals and no damage to property.

Eva is one of about two dozen national and international artists who have passed through Corsicana in the last few months as part of 100W, Hobratschk’s new residency program. From Iceland and Scotland, Chicago and Baltimore, they’ve come to this conservative corner of old-time Texas to get away from the big city, slow down and create art. What they find here, just 50 minutes from bustling Dallas, is a place with plenty of space and few interruptions. It started with a handful of Dallas artists and writers coming to visit but has turned into a full-blown happening here in Corsicana, and it’s got some people asking — and only partly in jest: Is this becoming the new Marfa? “When we were trying to do something, everybody agreed it starts with artists,” said Hale, who helped build up downtown’s economic core. “That’s just part of the evolution of Corsicana.” Corsicana was once a dusty downtown with empty storefronts, but is now coming to life again with new and revitalized work spaces. Leave the historic downtown district and there’s still widespread poverty. Newcomers are still learning to coexist with lifelong residents. Slowly but surely, though, Corsicana is becoming — to everyone’s surprise — cool. Clearing the weeds On the ground floor of one of Hale’s buildings downtown are two prints from historic Corsicana. One shows a rig spouting thick black oil in the middle of a cotton field. It shows where Corsicana has been. Hale leans in close to point out the workers picking cotton in the hot Southern sun. He’s been there, too. He was born a sharecropper in northern Mississippi, and his job as a child was to carry buckets of water to the middle of the field for break time. One day, when looking out over the cotton crop, he pointed out to another worker how picturesque it all was. The rolling fields, the black dirt punctuated with green crop and tufts of white. Those will all become beautiful shirts one day, he said. His friend, however, pointed to a nearby field full of weeds they had to clear. What would be beautiful, he said, is if someone could discover a way to make shirts from those weeds instead, so they wouldn’t have to work. “I never looked at anything the same after that,” Hale said. “That has changed how I see the world.” Just a few years ago, downtown Corsicana was like that field of weeds. “You could fire a cannon down the street and not hit anybody,” Hale said. The other print on the ground floor of Hale’s newly remodeled building is a panoramic shot of downtown Corsicana in 1923. Every parking spot is filled. The sidewalks are full of shoppers, the streets bustling with traffic. It shows what Corsicana could be again.
“I was super intimidated by it, I still am. This place is a monster,” Hobratschk said. “It already has and will continue to inform my work.” The cavernous building is mostly quiet during the day. Artists and writers move in and out, usually spending only about six weeks in Corsicana, making Pinto Bean, Hobratschk’s feisty Chihuahua, the building’s longest resident. Across the street is the studio of Nancy Rebal and her husband, David Searcy, an artist-and-writer pair from Dallas. Before Hobratschk opened the IOOF building to short-term artists, Rebal rented the third floor. When she first visited the city years ago, Rebal hated it. Too Podunk, too rural, not enough was happening. But today, she says, she finds Corsicana a perfect getaway from the metropolitan tempo of Dallas. Yet part of Corsicana’s appeal for most of the creative people moving there is its proximity to the big city. Only about 50 minutes down I-45, international artists are able to easily commute to downtown to show their work in Dallas galleries. “This is one NPR program away from the city,” Rebal said. “I can stay four or five days before I have to go back.” The soda fountain and painted pianos found dotted through downtown are just a few examples of Corsicana's legacy of americana and quirky, small town charm. (Photographs by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) The changes in Corsicana come as a double-edged sword, however. Everyone here knows that they need attention and money to outgrow the traditional, tired facade of small-town Texas. But change the city too much and it will lose its charm. “We’re here just to be here and make things, not to offend anybody or confront anybody,” Rebal said. “That’s something I don’t want to have happen to Corsicana is to have Dallas imposed on it.” Constant change Corsicana owes its name to José Antonio Navarro, Tejano leader of the Texas Revolution. He was behind Navarro County, which was created by the newly admitted state’s Legislature in 1846. Its county seat was established two years later, with a name that Navarro suggested to honor his father’s homeland of Corsica. Wolf Brand Chili started here in the 1890s, when Lyman T. Davis sold bowls for 5 cents apiece out of the back of a wagon on the corner where Across the Street Diner sits. A German immigrant began making fruitcakes around the same time and founded Collin Street Bakery — today nationally famous, and the subject of a 2015 Texas Monthly story following an embezzlement scandal at the bakery. Corsicana was largely insulated from the worst effects of the Great Depression by its investment in oil. (Photo via the Edward L. Williams historical postcard collection) In 1894, a company drilling artesian wells accidentally struck oil. It was the first large-scale oil deposit discovered west of the Mississippi. By 1898, when Hobratschk’s IOOF building was built, the Corsicana oil field had 287 wells producing 544,620 barrels annually. The boom brought overwhelming prosperity to the town. Electric streetlights and streetcars were installed. The Texas Electric Railroad added hourly service to Dallas in 1913. Huge homes were built. Saloons and other businesses prospered. But the old guard still tried to hold on to the sleepy-town image as best as possible. In 1919, Magnolia Petroleum Co. wanted to build two 29-story towers in downtown Corsicana with a skybridge connection. City leaders said no. Downtown Dallas would later say yes. Oil did protect Corsicana from the worst effects of the Great Depression, but the city began to dry up in the 1960s. Bethlehem Steel left town when the city denied the company tax breaks, and the middle class left with it. Population has steadily grown, but the downtown core wasted away for decades. Downtown Corsicana consists of a main business district along Beaton Street, where 100W and the other new businesses have begun to pop up on brick-lined streets. Around every corner is an antique shop and a church. The city is by no means idyllic. Last year, Corsicana was the scene of large protests against mass deportation arrests, and the town remains radically segregated by race and income. Drive into town from the east and you’ll see run-down trailers and black residents. Drive west of downtown and you’ll see two- and three-story plantation-style homes with Mercedes in the driveway in the mostly white neighborhood.
The IOOF building that is now used to house artists was briefly a Ku Klux Klan meeting space, Hobratschk said, and the group’s banners were still in the building when he bought it in 2012. “You don’t go where things are fine, you go where you can make things better,” Rebal said. “I really think there’s redemption.” Banners left behind by the Odd Fellows in what is now 100W, an artist- and writer-in-residency community. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) ‘Father Corsicana’ One of the first nights Edmund Eva, the Englishman, stayed in Corsicana, Hobratschk took the 100W artists to the home of one of their biggest supporters, Joe Brooks. The menu: chicken with green beans, potato salad and homemade peach cobbler. “Peach cobbler?” Eva asked. “I’ve only heard of it on television.” Joe B. Brooks, also called “Father Corsicana,” photographed at home with his dog, Frasier. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) Hobratschk calls Brooks “Father Corsicana.” In the 1970s, he was involved with the first efforts to boost arts in the city. He founded the Navarro Council for the Arts and helped raise money to refurbish The Palace, a 1921 vaudeville theater that brings in B-list country and Opry acts today. Brooks just celebrated his 81st birthday, and the retired school principal now splits his time between Corsicana and Santa Fe. He regularly hosts dinners for the 100W guests and others in town, where he’s able to foster connections between locals and the visiting artists. He takes an active role in supporting the newcomers at 100W, even as the arts council hasn’t embraced Hobratschk and company in the same way. The arts council is more focused on arts education in Navarro County schools than producing or displaying art these days, Brooks said. “It makes no sense,” he said. “I’m an old educator, so I get doing it for the kids, but there are adults with artistic talent that need to be nurtured.” In his study at home, Brooks keeps a caricature someone made of him back when he was helping start the arts council. The character is pulling a wagon full of statues and art and historic buildings that Brooks tried to save. He directed plays, made costumes, designed set pieces, raised money, planned parks, organized, inspired and kept pushing Corsicana forward. “It was really an outreach in those early days. I think it’s sad we don’t do that now,” Brooks said. “The marriage is available; people just have to look beyond the immediate.” Jimmy Hale helped change the cultural landscape of downtown Corsicana, with investments in several businesses, including the Across the Street Diner. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) That’s not to say the new artists have ignored local art, however. One of the 100W artists worked with a local theater group to paint backdrops for their performances. David Searcy and Nancy Rebal have worked with a local undiscovered artist, Wayne Hall, to show his work and profile him in The Paris Review. “A seed that’s planted but not nurtured is not going to blossom,” Brooks said. “That’s the kind of commitment you want. You’re not doing it for the money. You’re doing it for growth, not personal reward.” Yes, things are changing in Corsicana. Hollywood movie crews are coming in to capture its bucolic charm. For every dusty antique store that still sits on Beaton Street, there’s a storefront under construction for a new business or studio moving in. Brooks calls it a “renaissance.” That makes people like Jimmy Hale excited, but nervous. Standing on a corner downtown, just a block from his diner and bistro, he looks around. Out-of-towners are walking the street, browsing from shop to shop. A steady stream of vehicles passes down Beaton; all kinds of people are coming and going. It’s starting to look like that 1923 panorama again. “My biggest fear is we’re going to have so many people in five to 10 years that it won’t be a sleepy old town anymore,” he said, his voice starting to shake. “It’s like I’m killing the thing I love.” Hale turns suddenly and crosses the street, making sure to look both ways for the oncoming traffic moving down Beaton.
The visionary Room, with a muse For artist Kyle Hobratschk, a derelict building in a quiet town was the perfect place to find creative inspiration. Now he’s sharing it with other artists Something began vibrating inside of him the moment he walked inside. He studied the patina of the walls, the way the plaster had eroded over time with its stubborn, clinging bits of paint. He felt excitement and a kind of loneliness. Only it wasn’t the sad kind, but rather the promise of being alone with one’s thoughts and the work at hand. Yes, it was just an old building — ornate, three stories tall, regal even in its neglect with brick cornices and cast-stone arched windows. Its vast, decrepit rooms washed in slanting beams of sunlight welcomed him like an embrace. Kyle Hobratschk transformed a decrepit old building into sundrenched studio spaces and sumply furnished living quarters for his artists-in-residence at 100W. (LEFT: Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor, RIGHT: Photograph courtesy Kyle Hobratschk) Kyle Hobratschk knew this was a place he could make art. He was 23, a year out of Southern Methodist University art school. He had lingered like a stray dog at the campus studio and workshop as long as he could that summer. He needed his own space. By chance, an artist who had signed up for the printmaking class he taught in north Oak Cliff, Nancy Rebal, told him about this vacant building in Corsicana where her friends once lived. He had never heard of the town and had to consult a map. Appy to be a 100W resident 100 West grants artists and writers residencies to create work in this historic building repurposed for studio space. Large scale, light filled rooms are provided alongside complete living accommodations and wood shop access to produce work in two or three dimension, installation, or writing. The 2017 residency application deadline is Sept. 15, 2016.
More information about 100W Soon afterward, he stood on the sleepy downtown corner of West Third Avenue and Beaton Street and saw his future. That was 2012. He did not know the building would make him a better artist. He did not know it would teach him about the best and worst people are capable of. It would change him, though. It would help change a town. “Derelict,” was how Hobratschk’s friend, Kiernan Lofland, described the building when Hobratschk showed it to him. The two had met via SMU’s art program; another friend of theirs, Travis LaMothe, understood right away when he saw the iPhone photos: “As sculptors, space is a material.” By the time LaMothe finally made the trip down to see it, Hobratschk revealed on the front sidewalk that he had bought the building. He had never owned property before. Hobratschk had cobbled together a bank loan and promises from his artist friends to either invest sweat equity into making the cavernous place usable or rent space there. He had only the vaguest idea about creating a kind of art haven at this point. Rebal, the artist who first told him about the building, and her husband, writer David Searcy, later became the first tenants. (The building had belonged to their friend, the late Texas artist Doug MacWithey.) They set up camp essentially on the third floor. Searcy wrote an essay featuring Corsicana for his recent book, Shame and Wonder. Artist-writer couple Nancy Rebal and David Searcy, the first occupants of 100W. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) The following are excerpts from David Searcy’s essay “Nameless”, part of his most current work, Shame and Wonder, which describes Doug McWhithey, his late friend, who at one time owned the old Odd Fellows lodge, the silent magic of Corsicana and the building that is now 100W. How can I make this mean what it should? I will insist at least on meaning of some broad, unspecified sort. To get it started. I read somewhere – and I’m sure it came from some exalted source – that the study of Torah is so virtuous beyond all other virtues, that a gentile, even a gentile, who applies himself brings immeasurable joy to God. So here we go. My friend, the artist Doug MacWithey, owned a huge, historic, three-story former Odd Fellows hall in Corsicana, Texas. Though the scale of his work was usually rather small, he was inspired by these immense old spaces, loved, as much as anything, the sense of grand necessity, the fitting out, in this case, of the upper floors – their great high windows looking, from the corner, east and south along the main street – with these massively timbered ten-foot working tables of the kind that might, a hundred years before in similar vast, unheated rooms, have supported ranks of grim industrial sewing machines or grommet punches or something manned, as it were, by ghostly, sad-faced women. And although the big ideas that might have needed ten-foot tables never quite got into gear, and as his work, in fact, reduced to narrowing views of a very narrow field of interest, he required, all the more I think, all that expansiveness for reasons I was unable to appreciate (we had a running joke about the Disney character Goofy carving a toothpick from a tree), or fully appreciate at least, until after his death. I think such spaces meant to him a kind of endlessness. Historical and physical. Whatever concentrated, pared-away-to-almost-nothing bit of art he did, he wanted to be endless. As if nothingness and endlessness depended on each other. Even some isolated scribble would, in principle, in his heart, belong to an endless series endlessly elucidating endless variations on its faint, essential self. And when, as toward the end of his life, a single thought took hold, he’d go with it, he’d crank it out (most times with a little xerographic help) with no intention of ever shutting down until some practicality, like death of course, intruded. This is why he loved the xerox machine as well, I am convinced – less for the time saved copying patterns, than for the endlessness implied. How it suggested art might be cranked out forever automatically, might heap right up to the ceiling, spill from the windows, fill the street with blowing handbills bearing glimpses, advertisements, of the truth. Some sort of truth. You can’t escape it, can’t ignore it in a little town like that. All of a sudden here it comes, the blessed truth, right down the middle of the street. - - - The Odd Fellows hall is sold to a bright young artist friend of Nancy’s. And pretty soon he’s got this sort of atelier, this sort of residency going – weavers, painters, sculptors coming from Dallas, renting space, a communal kitchen. Ground floor woodshop. Nancy rents the whole third floor. At last a place removed from practical constraints where she can set her giant canvases like sails. I come to visit when I can. Her bright young artist friend, Kyle Hobratschk, comes and goes, as do the others. In the mornings it’s just me and Nancy usually. Making coffee in the kitchen on the second floor. Doug’s kitchen. Karan’s kitchen. Coffee and donuts in what used to be Doug’s studio, windows open, propped with 2X4’s, the sounds of trains and voices. And this little stapled pamphlet Kyle picked up from the Visitor Center. “Walking Tour of Historic Downtown Corsicana.” On page four, the tale of the wandering Jewish rope walker. Good Lord, Nancy, listen to this. At dusk, if no one’s down there working, I’ll descend to the second floor and stand for a while in the southeast corner where Doug usually spent his spare time. With windows open on two sides. There is a Main Street, but the real main street is Beaton Street which runs along the east side of the building. From the south side’s east-most window – right behind Doug as he worked – you get the best view straight down Beaton. If it weren’t for the trees, not here of course in 1884, you’d see to the Collin Street intersection, which the rope walker tried to cross. From the southeast corner at Collin and Beaton to the northwest, I believe. Doug, at his table, would have been facing away. But were the windows open, as they probably would have been, he would have turned at the sudden silence, then the cries. What had he missed? A vision, surely. Nothing real. But something meaningful, I think. I have decided. continue reading The couple would later buy the former Mombassa nightclub building across the street, dismantle its garish front sign with glee and remake it into their studio and residence. Hobratschk would leave them a bottle of champagne and glasses on closing day. Hobratschk vastly underestimated how much work the building needed. “It was borderline haunted, very damp. There were leaks in the roof,” he recalls. It was also magical. The 1898 structure was an original Odd Fellows lodge, meaning it has a specific, mystically inspired floorplan. The Independent Order of Odd Fellows building, which used to host Ku Klux Klan meetings and has been transformed into an artist residency program, pictued in downtown Corsicana in 1910. (Photograph courtesy Kyle Hobratschk) “There’s a lot of theory and special ritualistic reasons for why certain rooms are the way they are,” Hobratschk says. “So the third floor has a sacred sense to it because that’s where the Odd Fellows fraternity met.” The artists are drawn to this space, too. Sculptural chairs crafted by artist and 100W founder Kyle Hobratschk. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) The building had, at times, previously hosted Ku Klux Klan meetings and the Jewish Community Center. The ground level, with its storefront windows and cement floors, was typically rented out for income. The first tenant ran a meat market there. The last one before Hobratschk bought the place was a survivalist who sold Vietnam War memorabilia online. He kept an inoperable vintage Porsche painted in camouflage colors parked in the window. Hobratschk and the collective of founding artists for this project — whatever it would become — turned the ground floor into a wood shop to service the building. They used it then, as they do now, to make whatever they needed, from missing trim pieces to functional tables. Hobratschk also makes sculptural chairs, something he’d done in Dallas along with printmaking and painting. The artists’ first big triumph was buying a vintage three-quarter-ton industrial table saw that was trucked in on a flatbed trailer. It was so heavy that Hobratschk and his friends couldn’t figure out how to unload it. A guy named Danny watching from the NAPA Auto Parts store across the street walked over and told them what to do. While restoring the old, decrepit Odd Fellows lodge building, Kyle Hobratschk and his artist friends forged lasting friendships with the townspeople of Corsicana.

(Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor); RIGHT: Kiernan Lofland directs his friend and 100W founder Kyle Hobratschk (pictured driving) as they unload a vintage industrial table saw. (Photo courtesy Kyle Hobratschk) The group began making other connections, then friendships, in the town. Tom Adams owns the flower shop in the quaint brick building on the opposite corner. He loves to host cocktail parties for the artists in his extravagantly decorated living quarters above his shop. Hobratschk especially loved the night they had piña coladas and Bugles corn snacks served in crystal goblets paired with red onion dipping sauce. Hobratschk made the ultimate friend around this time. A stray brown Chihuahua who refused to leave his side. He was annoyed at first, then relented. He named her Pinto Bean. Kyle Hobratschk with his Chihuahua Pinto Bean. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) Grandiose ideas soon softened with harsh realities. The building isn’t air-conditioned and the days can be long, dusty and hot. On the third floor, Hobratschk built a narrow, wooden spiral staircase to the attic. Pop open a square hatch in the roof and you can climb the ladder to the flat roof and have a sprawling view of downtown Corsicana. The artists have come to love this roof. They will often sleep up there at night because it’s cooler than the stifling rooms below in late summer. Plus, there are the stars. Or inky storm clouds. In the mornings, Hobratschk brings his breakfast up here. He will watch the sunrise. He will marvel at the colors in the sky and think about how to paint them accurately.
A local man named Timothy Lusk began hanging around the building asking for work. This happens a lot to Hobratschk. He is the kid from Dallas with the kind smile and the Mercedes-Benz whom everyone is curious about. (The car was handed down from his mother, Celeste, a retired architect living with his father in Scottsdale, Ariz. He also drives his grandfather’s Ford pickup still permeated with West Texas red dust.) Lusk was resourceful. He could locate a leveling jack or a 35-foot ladder quickly and for nearly nothing. His truck didn’t run, so Hobratschk often drove him to his family’s house across the railroad tracks in the rougher, predominantly black part of town. Lusk worked hard. He also asked for more money a lot for various — and often outlandish — emergencies. Sometimes it felt like a betrayal to Hobratschk, like he was being taken advantage of. Regardless, the men formed an unlikely bond, a friendship. But then Lusk stopped showing up for work and eventually disappeared. Hobratschk later got a call from Lusk; he was in jail. It has taken almost four years to turn 100 West into what it is today, and it’s still a work in progress. In January, the first official artist residents arrived. They departed just last month, new works in tow. A philosophy is developing. Hobratschk recalled one early contributing artist, Randell Morgan, who stood on the second-floor landing and offered a pronouncement to him and Pinto Bean below. Morgan urged them to keep 100 West rule-less. “There are too many rules out there,” he said, motioning toward the window. That stuck with Hobratschk. He is also spreading his influence beyond the old Odd Fellows building. On a long walk awhile back, Hobratschk fell in love with a pared-down 1888 Queen Anne Victorian on a corner lot. “It feels like an Edward Hopper painting,” he said. Soon after purchasing 100W, Kyle Hobratschk bought and restored a white house near downtown as a less rustic alternative for guests and artists to stay. (Photograph by Nan Coulter/Special Contributor) He bought it and made it a joint labor of love with his mother, Celeste, who quickly took over the project. She had flown down many times to help with his first building. Now she was back to help restore the house, obsessing over finishes, procuring elegant linens. In his journal, Hobratschk noted that her presence lifts the place. She always opens the blinds to flood the house with light, whereas the workers never bother. The white house is now a comfortable place to stay for guests and artists (compared with the more rustic building downtown). Hobratschk crafted the bed frames by hand. Art from the 100 West group is displayed throughout. The detached carriage house out back will be finished by summer. The transient nature of what Hobratschk and his fellow artists have made is both by design and bittersweet. People and artwork will come and go. Living and working at 100W At 100W, residents live, work and play as a creative community. (Photos courtesy Nancy Rebal, Kyle Hobratschk and Benjamin Hines) On the day that LaMothe moved out of the building after his own residency of sorts, Hobratschk found the sudden absence strangely difficult. Even the ordinary objects now gone — an old tool chest, the turquoise Makita coffeemaker — felt like a palpable loss. This is the process of the building. It is not about permanence. He made a note about this in his journal: “It’s designed to accept artists transitionally,” he wrote. “It’s a place to make connections. “To make something and leave something.”

Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rat. But the chef, although he had motive, had served Bartlett the same rat burger every week for two years and was waiting to see the look on his face when he told him. Angela puts Booth on the trail of Margo Sandoval, Bartlett's assistant who was also having an affair with his wife. But she was simply protecting Bartlett's wife by shredding things that documented their affair. Meanwhile, Booth and Sweets are trying to figure out who had motive to kill Bartlett. Former clients Melanie and Gavin were the last ones seen with Bartlett, but when Booth and Brennan visit them, they claim to have reconciled in anticipation of a new baby. Hodgins puts Sweets on the trail of a chef who was a former client after he finds that Bartlett's last meal was a burger made of, the common brown rat. But the chef, although he had motive, had served Bartlett the same rat burger every week for two years and was waiting to see the look on his face when he told him.

is a space combat simulation, the first in the Star Wars universe. From the cockpits of X-Wing, Y-Wing and A-Wing starfighters, players fight for the Rebel Alliance in their struggle against the evil Galactic Empire.Unlike earlier titles in the genre like Wing Commander employs a polygonal 3D engine: flat-shaded polygons are combined with bitmaps only for explosion effects.The game features a comprehensive training element. Before starting on real missions, players should navigate the pilot proving grounds, also known as 'Maze', by flying through a course of doorways set atop platforms in space, preferably without missing any, all while keeping an eye on the tight time limit. Higher levels add additional challenges like hostile laser turrets. Next to the 'Maze', there are simulated historical missions (six for each of the three fighters) that prepare for the complex missions in the rest of the game.The main part of the game consists of three separate campaigns, called Tours of Duty. The Tours can be played in any order, even though they build on each other story-wise: Tour I, 'A New Ally', tells of the Rebellion's search for political allies in their fight against the Empire, while the Emperor launches Operation Strike Fear, a major offensive against the Rebels. Tour II, 'The Great Search' chronicles the Rebels' search for the plans to the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star. Tour III, 'The Gathering Storm', tells of their efforts to find and destroy the battle station. Animated cutscenes are featured after certain missions to continue the story.Each Tour consists of around a dozen missions, which include a wide variety of objectives. There are standard strike, escort and defense assignments, but also reconnaissance flights - just scanning ships without attacking them - or capture operations - disabling enemy ships, then protecting the transport carrying the strike team during the takeover. The game of course culminates in the famous attack on the Death Star.The three flyable fighters all handle differently and are thus more or less suitable for the different types of missions. The X-Wing is heavily armed and armored, and is usually used on strike missions. The Y-Wing is slower and less well protected, but is the only ship equipped with ion cannons, necessary for disabling ships. With its high speed and maneuverability, the A-Wing is ideal for recon and intercept missions.Next to lasers and ion cannons, the fighters are armed with limited amounts of warheads: proton torpedoes are slow and highly destructive, while concussion missiles are faster, but yield less damage.A unique feature of the game is energy management: Energy must be divided between engines, weapons and shields. At the standard settings, weapons and shields don't recharge - energy must be diverted from the engines for that, slowing the ship. On the other hand, putting more power into the engines adds speed, but drains shields and guns. Energy can also be transferred between the systems, boosting weapons power at the expense of shields or vice versa.Space is populated by many ships besides the player's, most of which are well-known from the movies. The Empire will usually launch waves of TIE Fighters, Interceptors and Bombers from Star Destroyers. The Rebels employ large Mon Calamari cruisers and Corellian Corvettes. In use by both sides are Nebulon-B escort frigates and Lambda-class shuttles. Some ships not seen in the movies include the Imperial assault gunboat, the stormtrooper transport and bulk freighters. Friendly fighters will sometimes accompany the player, and can be given specific orders.An Amiga version was announced in magazines but was never released. Perhaps a wise move since the game is almost unplayable without an analog joystick, and analog joysticks for the Amiga were rare.If you play the game on Christmas you will see Santa Claus on the floor of the Space Station after you have selected your pilot.The Death Star trench when playing with maximum detail settings (otherwise it's a bit like cheating) has a few more objects into which you can crash. Some of them look like T-shaped "bridges" and frameworks, which are absent in the originalmovie. It seems they are modeled after the Disneyland's Star Tours ride, which climaxes with the trench run. If you look closely, you can compare the differences and notice the fact that the Star Tours trench was built using bits of the second Death Star model (from), as it was constructed in mid-1980s. A minor detail, yet it adds more obstacles to dodge, which are not to be seen in the movie.The floppy install program was known to cause panic among first-time players. Instead of showing a percentage completed based on disks, it counted actual files. The problem was that half of the files were on the fifth and final disk. IE, you're installing it, it takes four disks just to reach the halfway mark, and you spend the entire last disk certain that your copy was incomplete.Theof(the original floppy disk based release) contained a companion book called. This book contained spec sheets for the various spacecraft in the game, short stories, a "who's who" for the races of theuniverse and much more. Theversions are identifiable only by a small round sticker on the front of the box. Apart from, the contents are the same as the normal version of the game.Ready to fight back?

Why have you started yet anothertranslation topic?Because the first attempt was utter fail, the topic creator having been banned and the thread locked. In the second attempt , the topic creator went AWOL over 2 years ago (made 10 posts and disappeared forever), and there was no organization. As active members who are directly involved in the project, we wanted control of the first post so we could update the topic easily. Third time's a charm?Will this be a full translation?Absolutely.Can I help translate or edit?Can you read this image ? If yes, send a PM to Densetsu with your English translation of the image. If it's good enough, you will receive a short test designed to further assess your translating ability. If you pass, we want you on the team! The test will consist of an image containing Japanese text including kanji, so you won't be able to cheat by copy-pasting the text into a dictionary. We do not allow machine translations. We want people who actuallyand canJapanese. Experience in playing the game is a plus. We are no longer accepting additional editing help unless you know Japanese. The editing has gotten to the point where you must be able to check the translation against the original Japanese (and play the game in Japanese for context), so even our current editors can't really do much to help at this point in the project timeline.Can I be a beta-tester?Once the translations have been finished, we will be looking for people who are serious about contributing to the project, not people who "just want to try the patch." As such, the beta test will be invite-only and we will ask a handful of well-known, reputable members who are willing to test it for us. Those who beta-test will be credited in the project. When the beta-testing phase is opened, we will provide the testers with information about proper bug report format (we will require beta-testers to submit screenshots with the reports).When will you release a patch?After beta-testing is completed.Is there any way you can speed up the project?Robbie Dinwoodie reported in Friday’s Herald (here) that it was likely the Scotland Bill Committee at Holyrood would recommend that the Parliament withhold legislative consent unless joint commencement arrangements for the income tax provisions were agreed. It’s odd that this particular issue should seemingly be the decisive one, though less so if one looks at the conduct of the various parties.
But perhaps the key issue is the way the Scottish block grant is to be cut to allow for the new devolved power over income tax. This has been a key objection of mine to the bill’s proposals, from the time it was published just under a year ago. It ought to be fairly straightforward to calculate the first year’s reduction, and illustrative figures for that could have been prepared when the first UK Government white paper was published in November 2009 (but wasn’t). What’s more difficult is the methodology for adjusting that amount in subsequent years, so the amount by which the block grant is reduced in year 5 or year 10 after the new system is introduced is still ‘proportional’. This issue was covered in a single sentence into the Calman Commission report, but took 10 pages in the Holtham commission’s report looking at the same issue for Wales. Although the first Scotland Bill Committee made a recommendation about the approach based on the evidence of Gerald Holtham, the UK Government has still not set out its position about this vital issue – two and a half years, now, since the Calman report was published. All Moore could say about this when questioned about it before the Holyrood committee last week was that a meeting with the Scottish Government had agreed ‘principles’ for the calculation, though he did not divulge what those principles were or how far the agreement went, and that the committee – and implementation of the Act – meant he should be trusted. It was telling that many of the sharpest questions on this point came from David McLetchie, the only Conservative on the committee. They aren’t limited to the SNP, nor should they be.
Japan's Nikkei 225 finished a wild day down 7.9 per cent, its biggest loss since the global financial crisis in 2008. South Korea's Kospi sank 3.1 per cent, its worst day in four years. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 4.4 per cent and stocks in Shanghai, Taiwan, Sydney, Mumbai and Southeast Asian countries were sharply lower.But during the questioning of your own decision, it’s a dreadful, miserable period. I think about if I’ll end up regretting it. I wonder how it will look and feel. I start to question my transition as a whole. It honestly scares me whenever I have that last thought, whether or not my transition was a good thing. There’s never a lingering or strong enough feeling for me to start regretting or thinking it was a mistake, considering what’s going on the other 99% of the time during my life- optimism, clear-headed thinking, happiness, feeling freer to be myself than I ever have felt…and things like that. But I’m usually scared to mention any of these thoughts, in fear that whomever I say them to will start leading me further down a path of, “see, you weren’t trans after all!”At around noon Tuesday the Israeli Navy intercepted and took control of a boat that had set sail for the Gaza Strip with three tons of medical supplies, Palestinian sources said, adding that the Navy jammed the boat's radio signals.
I've said over the years in interviews throughout the world, "Just like the human body is 70% water, I'm 70% film". While this is a figure of speech, there is some truth to it. I learned, or rather was taught, much from film, including things I didn't learn in school or from my parents. Through film, I've met different races and cultures, seen the world through the eyes of other generations, and adopted ideologies. I've been to new countries and exotic lands, and gone to outer space as well. I've traveled to the distant past and far into the future. I've fought in ancient conflicts and fictional wars. I've even experienced what it's like to be something other than human. Part of my sustenance growing up was the virtual experiences I had through this medium. There's nothing unique about this. I'm sure everyone in my generation is the same, for films are no longer mere diversions. All of the films I've seen, regardless of their content, are part of my virtual life. I've been shaped by my actual experiences, but also by my virtual experiences through film. However, the seven listed above are by no means the only ones that had a hand in MGS. And many others influenced me as a person, with my current self a result of the battle they fought with my actual experiences. Even if they didn't directly contribute to MGS, they are without a doubt part of my chromosomes, DNA and memes. That's how I'd define my "favorite films".
Get Ready For the Kickoff! Beyond the Sideline Football Announced Last week's Out of the Park Baseball 15 announcement wasn't all we had planned - Today, just in time for this Sunday's big game between the Seahawks and the Broncos, we're unveiling the latest addition to our excellent lineup of sports management games - Beyond the Sideline Football. BTS Football is being created by lead developer Francis Cole, who previously worked on Football Manager at Sports Interactive and joined Out of the Park Developments in October. He is a lifelong football fan and even created a football simulation as part of his college studies. "I've known Francis since my days working at Sports Interactive," says OOTP Developments co-founder Markus Heinsohn. "He is a tremendously talented programmer who knows American football as well as anyone I've ever met and he has been working on his own football gaming projects for years. I am convinced that his skills, combined with our experience creating award-winning sports management games, will result in an amazing American football game which will bolster our product lineup for years to come." "Having known Markus from our time at Sports Interactive together, and playing OOTP every year since, I was delighted at the opportunity to bring my football game to OOTP Developments," says Beyond the Sideline lead developer Francis Cole. "Beyond the Sideline will be an amazing American football GM game, thanks to technology such as FaceGen, releasing on PC/Mac/Linux, and having an existing code base that enables players to easily customize their leagues." Beyond the Sideline Football will reach Beta in about a year, with a shipping date sometime in 2015. The game will offer these features: A realistic modern day American football experience with all current rules and regulations.
Driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication, the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured,[103] and the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from PV is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions. Net metering and financial incentives, such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity, have supported solar PV installations in many countries.[104] The Energy Payback Time (EPBT), also known as energy amortization, depends on the location's annual solar insolation and temperature profile, as well as on the used type of PV-technology. For conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaics, the EPBT is higher than for thin-film technologies such as CdTe-PV or CPV-systems. Moreover, the payback time decreased in the recent years due to a number of improvements such as solar cell efficiency and more economic manufacturing processes. As of 2014, photovoltaics recoup on average the energy needed to manufacture them in 0.7 to 2 years. This results in about 95% of net-clean energy produced by a solar rooftop PV system over a 30-year life-time.[105]:30 Installations may be ground-mounted (and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing) or built into the roof or walls of a building (either building-integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop).
A more thorough explanation of Costa Rica’s poverty. ‘Growth without Poverty Reduction: The Case of Costa Rica’. The Cato InstituteWell, lucky for you, I still had a link on one of my LJ posts to one of the series of scans that psychousagi had posted of the story over on scans_daily (and if anyone else has the rest of this story, I'll gladly edit this post to include it).As ham-handed and cringe-worthy as this Old-School Marvel After-School Special might seem to our modern storytelling sensibilities, I have to say, there's a lot that it does right.Back in the days when most portrayals of sexual assault in the mainstream media still amounted to "stranger-in-the-bushes rape" committed by obviously creepy, often older men (and ALWAYS men, never NOT men), this simple little PSA comic showed that both men AND women, who were relatively young themselves, were capable of committing the sexual abuse of children.More importantly, it addressed the fear and pain that a child would feel, from being violated by an adult whom they'd previously liked and trusted so much, as well as the guilt that a child would feel, from sensing that they've somehow done something "wrong," to displease either the adult who violated them or the adults they've been told to "keep a secret" from.Even more importantly, it gave an iconic superhero like Spider-Man a background as a survivor of sexual abuse, but it didn'this life story to that one moment. On average, one out of every four women, and one out of every six men, suffers such an assault during his or her lifetime, and yes, that's obviously going to be a huge trauma for them to recover from, but the mistake that too many writers make is to assume that such an event will somehow exclusivelythose people's lives, like Bruce Wayne seeing his parents get shot turned him into Batman. By contrast, what Peter Parker's story shows here is that you can heal from this type of hurt, and it doesn't make you "damaged" or "broken" or "unlovable" or any other such nonsense.Most importantly, though, this PSA comic, for as clunky as its plotting and narration might seem to our more sophisticated tastes, deals with this subject in a sensitive, non-threatening way, that makes it clear to kids thatAs a little boy Lou Ferrigno put on a hearing aid every morning. Other kids teased him, which led to schoolyard fights that Ferrigno lost. For comfort he would read “The Incredible Hulk” comic book, one of his favorites. “ I felt devastated and emotionally insecure. I would just read the comics and it would give me inspiration and hope,” Ferrigno said. Ferrigno didn’t stop there. He began to lift weights and body build to gain the super strength his comic book hero had. By the age of 22, Ferrigno had won the “Mr. Universe” title twice.
Walton considers the balance of power and sees a potential tipping point, wherein the court becomes the seat of power. This power-shift could be an issue, but one that could be mitigated somewhat by the installation of a public advocate, as has been suggested by the PCLOB (Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board).Walton seems resistant to turning the court into an oversight entity, which it really isn't. That'sto be the legislative branch's role, but that has been undermined by cheerleaders masquerading as overseers who have withheld information from their fellow legislators. Walton also may not trust the agency enough at this point to feel comfortable approving RAS requests. His earlier declassified court orders pointed out that the agency deliberately misrepresented its tactics and day-to-day operations to the court for nearly a half-decade. Approving an RAS request means having some faith that the evidence being presented is true and Walton doesn't seem to have that confidence.Why this lack of confidence should mean allowing the NSA to continue to access the collection without limitation isn't discussed by Walton's statements, but that's the only alternative if the court decides it doesn't want this burden, something Walton indicates is a possibility.That being said, Walton notes the court is also not expressly forbidden from performing this function and admits the FISA court has performed this function before.As it stands right now, the NSA is back to its 2009 form, in terms of seeking court approval for collection searches. The current order will expire towards the end of March, at which point the court will revisit this requirement. As Techdirt noted earlier, Walton's term with the FISA court is ending, so this decision will possibly rest in the hands of two incoming judges or another FISA judge who may not be quite as amenable to the administration's reform demands. For the time being, the NSA will have to somehow "make do" with showing some sort of evidence before being allowed to search its bulk collections, which is a definite improvement over its previous unrestricted access.
Okay, so as the news is making the rounds that Alpha 12 has overdone alert level nerfs and is by far the easiest release yet, I report that bad decisions are still enough to kill a good playerI was doing fine until I decided, just for fun, toI already have a good win in 12, so now I'm more willing to take risks and fool around, but from that point on it was downhill as I got picked apart in the caves. I still survived for several floors after that, but my suboptimal propulsion was always an issue, forcing me to use a combination of treads, legs, hover, and wheels...What did me in was happening upon an absolutely crazy convergence of squads (partially of my own doing because I was wreaking havoc). Just look at these guys...I did find tons of launchers in this seed, though. Quite different from my winning run this week where there were only two the whole run!The "pristine Storage grunts" escorted me through two floors early on. Here we are making our way into the caves for an immediate showdown:I got to lay traps for the first time, too! That was a lot of fun; definitely some good new strategies there. I didn't get an Extractor myself (they fizzled...), but looting the Minesweeper's inventory was enough. Being my first time I made some mistakes in trap placement, and also only later realized that because I didn't have an Extractor, once I'd put them in the wrong place I couldn't get them back again xDFirst, begin by folding your your graph paper in half (excluding three boxes on the perforated side). Once the paper has been folded appropriately, make two marks--13 full boxes apart (allow for a further box back behind the airframe). Use a ruler to make a straight line with the length of 13 boxes directly up 1 row of boxes from the two marks you just made. Then make the stabilizers, spars and counterweight as shown.
TN: I think any show has the potential to bring about social change. I do not think any one show in isolation can do it. I think it is a groundswell that needs to continue to be bolstered from all ends. So when you’re talking about an issue, for instance, if you look at all the issues we’ve been experiencing over the past few weeks or months—trans rights in America, LGBT rights, the proliferation of guns, the police shootings—all of these things, they need a certain level of groundswell. One show can’t do it, but when you multiply everyone on Twitter, everyone on TV, just everyone, that begins to bring it to life. That begins to make it bigger than just what it could be without that. And so I don’t think any one show has that power or ability, which is good because that could go either way, but we have a fantastic platform to be part of something bigger than just ourselves, which I take all the time and I use. And that’s not just because it’s The Daily Show, it’s because it’s a platform, and that’s what my platform has always been in comedy and in life. Like on Twitter, you can’t do anything by yourself, but you post something and it might be retweeted and retweeted, and next thing you know it’s trending, and it all came from one person. And so that’s how I look at the show. We have to start it somewhere, so let’s get started.
The name “cracker” comes from a fateful day in 1801 in Massachusetts when Josiah Bent accidentally burned a batch of what we now call crackers. As the crackers burned, they made a crackling noise, which inspired the name. Bent was also the one who pioneered the cracker as a snack food, not just for sailors rations as his competition were selling them as. To make them popular as a snack food, he knew he’d have to improve on the flavor. He experimented around until he eventually came up with soda crackers, which were precursors to saltine crackers. By 1810, Bent’s cracker business was incredibly successful and it eventually was acquired by the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco). However, you can still buy crackers made by the company Bent’s grandson founded, G.H. Bent Co.It’s just after 1PM ET, and Microsoft’s servers are blazing with a hot new update for Windows Phone 8.1 . The update will bump the OS to version 8.10.12393.890 and it's about 21 MB in size, though what changes the update includes is currently not known. This is the second update to come out for Windows Phone 8.1. The first update for Windows Phone 8.1 came in mid-May and introduced battery improvements.
Give ample notice, preferably at least 6 months in advance of the change. One year or more would be even better. Provide that notice via an official government decree or passage of a law. Publish the law, and make it available online on an official government web site. Be sure to include the precise details of the change, including the date and the time of day that the change is to go into effect. For example, state "the clocks will advance forward by 30 minutes on April 1st, 2017 at 01:00 local time". Do not just say "The time will change in April". Also, if the change only affects a particular region of your country, please specify the exact areas that are affected. Notify your citizens and the world via press releases and the news media, but do not rely solely on this to communicate the change. The official decree or law should trump any statement made to the press. Send notification to the TZ community. To do this, simply send an email to tz@iana.org, which is the address for the tz discussion list. The email should contain a URL to the announcement published on an official government web site. If the change is to be aborted, please give ample notice of that as well.
Srila Prabhupada: Yes. Both the fire and the spark are fire, but one is big, and the other is very small. Unlike the relationship between the spark and the fire, however, our relationship with God is eternal, although at the present moment we have forgotten that relationship due to contact with the material energy. We are facing so many problems only because of this forgetfulness. If we can revive our original God consciousness, then we shall become happy. This is the sum and substance of Krishna consciousness. It is the best process to revive our original God consciousness. There are different processes of self-realization, but in the present age of Kali, people are very fallen, and they require the simple process of Krishna consciousness. Now they are thinking that so-called material advancement is the solution to their problems, but this is not a fact. The real solution is to get out of the material condition entirely by becoming Krishna conscious. Because God is eternal, we are also eternal, but in the material condition we are thinking, “I am this body,” and therefore we must repeatedly change from body to body. This is due to ignorance. Actually we are not our bodies but spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of God.
Srila Prabhupada: Yes. According to your desires at the time of death, you get another body. That body is not guaranteed to be a human body, however. As I’ve already explained, there are 8,400,000 different forms of life. You can enter any of them, according to your mental condition at death. What we think of at the time of death depends on how we act during our life. As long as we are in material consciousness, our actions are under the control of the material nature, which is being conducted in three modes: goodness, passion, and ignorance. These modes are like the three basic colors—yellow, red, and blue. Just as one can mix red, yellow, and blue to produce millions of colors, similarly, the modes of nature are being mixed to produce many varieties of life. To stop the repetition of birth and death in different forms of life, we must transcend the covering of material nature and come to the platform of pure consciousness. But if we do not learn the transcendental science of Krishna consciousness, then at death we must transfer to another body, either better or worse than our present one. If we cultivate the mode of goodness, then we are promoted to the higher planetary system, where there is a better standard of life. If we cultivate the mode of passion, then we will remain at the present stage. But if out of ignorance we commit sinful activities and violate nature’s laws, then we will be degraded to animal or plant life. Then again we must evolve to the human form, a process that may take millions of years. Therefore a human being must be responsible. He must take advantage of the rare opportunity of human life by understanding his relationship with God and acting accordingly. Then he can get out of the cycle of birth and death in different forms of life and go back to home, back to Godhead.
Previous studies suggested that aggressive mood leads to the preference of aggressive humour (e.g. Bowker and Etkin 2014; McCauley et al. 1983; Prerost 1983). Therefore, it would not have been a surprise for this study to show that subjects who enjoy reading cartoons dealing with nasty or morbid contents also show high levels of aggression. Quite surprisingly, it could be shown that subjects who present high levels of aggressiveness (i.e. aggressiveness directed against others) are most likely to dislike black humour and show lower values with respect to black humour comprehension than subjects with low aggression values. It can be hypothesized that higher levels of aggressiveness and associated levels of arousal lead to decreased levels of pleasure when reading black humour wits, an assumption which contradicts the results of Prerost (1983). Furthermore, it could be shown that subjects who are in a bad mood are most likely to dislike black humour and show lower values with respect to black humour comprehension than subjects who show low mood disturbance. These results support studies which show that subjective humour response is influenced by pre-existing mood (Neumann et al. 2001) as well as the notion that bad mood impairs the involvement in humour rather than facilitating the appreciation of aggressive humour (Ruch and Köhler 1998). According to Mindess and colleagues (1985), preference for sick humour is related to the ability to treat nasty contents as playful fiction. Seemingly, only those subjects who have no aggressive feelings towards others as well as no mood disturbance such as dysphoric or depressive mood can afford or get away with the playful exposure in the course of black humour processing. Another hypothesis would be that aggressiveness as well as bad mood could lead to a reduced information-processing capacity with respect to cognitively demanding humorous contents.
In this study, a strong association between black humour processing and verbal as well as nonverbal intellectual capacities can be shown. Subjects who show higher verbal and nonverbal intelligence scores show highest values with respect to black humour preference and comprehension. These results are in line with other studies which show a strong association between intelligence scores and humour processing (e.g. Greengross and Miller 2011) and indicate that such associations can also be seen for black humour processing. The role of intelligence in humour processing was recently investigated by Vrticka and colleagues (2013) in the light of the incongruity-resolution model (Suls 1972). They could show that in childhood and adolescence higher intelligence supports the detection of incongruities in a verbal utterance as well as the successful reinterpretation of these incongruities so as to get the joke. Furthermore, they could show that higher intelligence in this age-span is associated with stronger activity in brain areas involved in humour processing. Given the results of the current study, it can be hypothesized that in adulthood intelligence still strongly influences this two-stage problem-solving process with respect to humour processing. In this study, it could also be shown that the subjects who were most likely to comprehend and prefer black humour also have higher education levels. This result would be in line with another Freudian theory (1905) which states that subjects with high socio-economic status are more appreciative of aggressive humour (as long as it is thought to be within the bounds of good taste). This theory was not supported by McCauley and colleagues (1983), whilst the results of the current study showed that subjects with higher education show higher values with respect to black humour preference which is surprising considering the sinister, aggressive and tragic contents of black humour.
In the current study, a strong association between black humour comprehension and preference for black humour is shown. This result supports the findings of previous studies (Herzog and Bush 1994; Herzog and Karafa 1998) and indicates that higher comprehension of black humour wits leads to higher pleasure when reading it. Vrticka and colleagues (2013) indicate that intelligence not only influences the cognitive aspects of humour processing but also the affective components. In this context, the results of the current study as well as previous results (Coulson 2001) indicate that cognitive abilities like verbal and nonverbal intelligence as well as processing speed but also emotional aspects influence the mental operations underlying humour processing. On the one hand, it can be hypothesized that in the course of humour processing intelligence as well as mood and aggression directly influence the capacity to semantically reanalyse and reorganize categories and structures of thought (‘frame-shifting model’ by Coulson 2000), to combine these aspects into a meaningful humorous hybrid situation (‘frame blends model’ by Hofstadter and Gabora 1989; ‘blending model’ by Coulson 2001) and to adequately reinterpret the product of the previous mental operations (‘incongruity-resolution model’ by Suls 1972) so as to get the joke. It can be assumed that the extent to which each of these operations is needed for the comprehension of a joke varies depending on the content and structure of the joke. In this context, it can be hypothesized that intelligence, processing speed, aggression and mood not only influence the execution of the mental operations themselves but also facilitate the adapting of humour processing strategies in a quick and flexible way. The results in the current study support this hypothesis. On the other hand, it is likely that in the course of humour processing individual values with respect to intelligence, aggression and mood are likely to interact with the content of a joke. In the light of the previously mentioned models of humour processing, future studies could investigate whether mainly cognitive, mainly emotional or mixed contents require more mental effort.The Somali-born Minnesota police officer alleged to have shot and killed an unarmed Australian woman on Saturday had been lauded by Minneapolis’ mayor and feted by the local community when he joined the force in 2015.
The PHOTO in the mail is the “Pulitzer prize” winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan famine. The PHOTO in the mail is the “Pulitzer prize” winning photo taken in 1994 during the Sudan famine. The picture depicts a famine stricken child crawling towards an United Nations food camp, located a kilometer away. The vulture is waiting for the child to die so that it can eat it. This picture shocked the whole world. No one knows what happened to the child, including the photographer Kevin Carter who left the place as soon as the photograph was taken. Three months later he committed suicide due to depression. This was found in his diary, “Dear God, I promise I will never waste my food no matter how bad it can taste and how full I may be I pray that He will protect this little boy, guide and deliver him away from his misery. I pray that we will be more sensitive towards the world around us and not be blinded be our own selfish nature and interests.” I hope this picture will always serve as a reminder to us that how fortunate we are and that we must never ever take things for granted.
In 1993 Carter headed north of the border with [friend and fellow journalist] João Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine-stricken Sudan.

To make the trip, Carter had taken a leave from the [South Africa]and borrowed money for the air fare. Immediately after their plane touched down in the village of Ayod, Carter began snapping photos of famine victims. Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death, he wandered into the open bush. He heard a soft, high-pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center. As he crouched to photograph her, a vulture landed in view. Careful not to disturb the bird, he positioned himself for the best possible image. He would later say he waited about 20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings. It did not, and after he took his photographs, he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle. Afterward he sat under a tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried. “He was depressed afterward,” Silva recalls. “He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter.” After another day in Sudan, Carter returned to Johannesburg. Coincidentally, the New York Times, which was looking for pictures of Sudan, bought his photograph and ran it on March 26, 1993. The picture immediately became an icon of Africa’s anguish. Hundreds of people wrote and called the Times asking what had happened to the child (the paper reported that it was not known whether she reached the feeding center); and papers around the world reproduced the photo. Friends and colleagues complimented Carter on his feat. His self-confidence climbed.
The Braamfonteinspruit is a small river that cuts southward through Johannesburg’s northern suburbs — and through Parkmore, where the Carters once lived. At around 9 p.m., Kevin Carter backed his red Nissan pickup truck against a blue gum tree at the Field and Study Center. He had played there often as a little boy. The Sandton Bird Club was having its monthly meeting there, but nobody saw Carter as he used silver gaffer tape to attach a garden hose to the exhaust pipe and run it to the passenger-side window. Wearing unwashed Lee jeans and an Esquire T-shirt, he got in and switched on the engine. Then he put music on his Walkman and lay over on his side, using the knapsack as a pillow.

After coming home from New York, he wrote, he was “depressed … without phone … money for rent … money for child support … money for debts … money!!! … I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings & corpses & anger & pain … of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners … “
The thing is, we wanted to keep this short and, to put it gently, it all got a little bit crazy. And we couldn’t leave any of the craziness out. What happened? You’ll have to watch for yourself. But let’s just say it was sweet and scary. Like that psychedelic boat-ride bit in Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. Like a cocktail that’s on fire. Enough talk, read these, then watch the video. NB: It all gets very real at about 5:40 if you’re time poor. Special thanks to Pierrick Boyer, Le Petit Gateaux and the smooth operators at Nice Bike who produced the video.The founder of the budget firearms company Hi-Point, Tom Deeb has recently passed away at his semi retirement home in Texas. He was 65 years old and died from cardiac arrest. Deeb founded the company in 1993 with a simple philosophy of creating a budget firearm for the firearms community. Despite much of the criticism that Hi-Point gets, to include myself poking fun at the company from time to time, you do have to give it credit for the niche that it occupies, in being low cost and reliable. Other companies have tried to bring low cost firearms to the market, and have failed because their guns were unreliable. Hi-Point on the other hand, not only produces budget guns, and for the most part, they can be very reliable. I’ve even heard some good things about their carbines as well. To date the company has produced over 2 million firearms.
"This was never just about the state visit," the statement reads. "Every day the British government gets closer to Trump in its policies—from refusing to guarantee the basic rights of EU migrants, to ending the Dubs Amendment scheme for child refugees. We urge people to join a growing movement that fights for the rights of migrants and minorities—for an inclusive and democratic society."Bernie Sanders’ campaign ended months ago, but at least one Jewish participant in this reliably horrific presidential election still has the chance to make history on November 8th. According to an Emerson College poll published this week, Evan McMullin, the independent conservative candidate for president, holds a slim lead over Donald Trump in his home state of Utah, topping Trump 31% to 27%. If McMullin were to win The Beehive State, the ex-CIA agent and former director of the House Republican Conference would snag six entire electoral votes—as would his running mate, former Republican strategist (and, we should note, member of the Tribe) Mindy Finn. This would be the first time since a maverick elector cast a vote for Libertarian John Hospers in 1972 that a third-party candidate took home an electoral tally, something that such one-time household names as John Anderson, Ross Perot, and Ralph Nader couldn’t accomplish. (In an ironic reversal, the last third-party candidate to win a state was segregationist George Wallace in 1968.)
Travis was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Cavalry and became the chief recruiting officer for a new regular Texian army.[18] Governor Henry Smith ordered Travis to raise a company of professional soldiers to reinforce the Texians who were then under the command of James C. Neill at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio.[21] Travis considered disobeying his orders, writing to Smith: "I am willing, nay anxious, to go to the defense of Bexar, but sir, I am unwilling to risk my reputation ... by going off into the enemy's country with such little means, so few men, and with them so badly equipped." James Bowie arrived at the Alamo with 30 men on January 19, 1836.[21] On February 3, Travis arrived in San Antonio with eighteen regulars as reinforcements. A compromise was reached between Bowie and Travis for command of the Alamo, with Bowie in command of the volunteers and Travis in command of the regulars. When Bowie's health began to fail the compromise became irrelevant, and Travis became the official commander of the Alamo garrison.[21] On March 6, 1836, following a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna ordered the assault on the Alamo during the predawn hours. Travis died fighting to the end, and his remains were burned along with all the other Alamo defenders.[21]
Fellow citizens and compatriots; I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual Bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat . Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country. VICTORY or DEATH. William Barret Travis Lt. Col. Comdt. P.S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls 20 or 30 head of Beeves. Travis
With the Democrats trusting our well-being to the likes of Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner, who under President Bill Clinton did so much to enable Wall Street greed, would it not be good to have at least one Republican senator questioning the Washington spending spree? Yes, Rand Paul is bad on a lot of social issues I care about, and no, I don't embrace his faith in the social compassion of unfettered free markets. But the alternative we have experienced is not one of a progressive government properly restraining free-market greed but rather, as was amply demonstrated in the pretend regulation of the oil industry, of government as a partner in corporate crime. It is the power of the corporate lobbyists that is at issue, and it is refreshing that candidate Paul has labeled Washington lobbyists a "distinctly criminal class" and favors a ban on lobbying and campaign contributions by those who hold more than a million dollars in federal contracts.Developers can use flags for many different things, but today the use-case we're going to discuss is all about protecting your data.

McIntyre blogs at dmwineline.com. On Twitter: @dmwine.Have you ever noticed that whenever it comes time to stand on principle top Republican lawmakers always fold like a 20 dollar suit? This time it was John Boehner. It went down like this – the Democrats knew that if they played hardball and set up a government shutdown for the weekend of the Cherry Blossom Festival that Boehner would cave. Boehner took negotiations up to the last minute to make it “look good” for the Tea Party, but the truth is that Boehner wanted nothing to do with a government shutdown and the Democrats knew that. The Democrats drew their lines in the sand on issue after issue and Boehner caved and caved and caved. So now it is time to fire John Boehner along with Barack Obama in 2012. Boehner must go. If the Tea Party is serious about cutting government spending then they must hold John Boehner accountable and go after his seat during the next primary season. The truth is that the “budget deal” is a complete and total joke. A one percent cut to the U.S. government budget is laughable. Is that why dozens of Tea Party activists were sent to Washington D.C.? If this is the “best” that can be done, the truth is that there is no hope of ever getting U.S. government debt under control.
I got kicked out of a public, federal immigration court hearing yesterday because I’m a newspaper reporter. And it wasn't the judge who wanted me to leave. It was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorney. Here's what happened.For several months, I've been observing the immigration court in San Francisco. Mostly I've sat in on bond hearings and "removals," more commonly known as deportations. The entire time, ICE attorneys and private security guards have been attempting to limit my access.Yesterday was the worst.At 1 p.m., I walked into Courtroom 18, inside the 100 Montgomery Street offices of the Department of Homeland Security, to observe several deportation cases on Judge Joren Lyons' calendar. I quietly sat down in the second row to the back. Eight other people, family members of two individuals whose cases were on the calendar, were also present.When the judge entered, he asked those of us sitting in the public seats if we were there for a particular case. The others all replied affirmatively, but none of them was made to identify their profession, state their name, or produce any identification.The judge then asked me. "I'm here to observe," I answered. And the judge had no problem with that.According to the official rules of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which runs the immigration courts, hearings are generally open to the public unless a specific case involves an asylum request or an abused child or spouse, or where a sealed protective order has been filed. Parties to a case can also submit motions to the court in advance of a hearing to request it be closed. And judges have discretion to close hearings to protect parties, witnesses, and the public interest. But, generally, immigration courts are supposed to operate transparently. Open hearings that are accessible to everyone, including reporters who let the public know what their government is doing, are in the public interest.But before Judge Lyons could begin, the ICE attorney seated in the front of the courtroom turned around and looked straight at me. "Who are you?" he asked.I responded with a question of my own: "Why do you want to know?""Are you a member of the press?" he questioned me.I didn't answer his question. Instead, I asked again why he wanted to know if I was a reporter."I have a right to know if you are media," he said. "We have procedures."At that point, I politely said I wasn't aware of any rules requiring observers in the courtroom to identify themselves, on demand, to the prosecuting attorney.The ICE attorney, Michael Alster, then asked the judge for a delay. "I want to take care of this situation with this gentleman first," he said while walking out of the courtroom. I told Alster on his way out I'd like to speak with his supervisor, as well.While the ICE attorney was gone, Judge Lyons allowed the family members of one of the men on trial to talk to him through the teleconferencing system. They gathered in front of the camera, laughing and smiling, and asked the man, who was appearing via video stream from a distant jail, how he was doing. The judge also accepted from the family some documents they had brought to support his case.At this point, it's worth noting that I didn't know anything about the man's case. I didn't go into the courtroom to report on his hearing, nor the seven other people whose cases were on the judge's calendar. I was there, in fact, working on a story about how the immigration courts operate.One thing I did note while sitting there: The man whose hearing was underway had no attorney. His family hadn't hired one, either.Lots of people facing deportation can't afford counsel, and are therefore deprived of professional legal advice. It's a common problem in immigration courts. They go up against ICE attorneys on their own. In San Francisco's immigration courts, only 15 percent of people in detention are represented by an attorney.State and local officials recognize this problem and are currently considering legislation that would provide legal representation to Californians in immigration courts. But under existing federal rules, even indigent children are left to represent themselves, or hire their own attorneys.About ten minutes later, Alster returned. He paused at the bench where I was sitting and informed me that his supervisor, Leslie Ungerman, has an office on the second floor.With that, I figured Alster had dropped his demand that I identify myself, but I was wrong. He took his seat at the front of the courtroom, and as the judge was filling him in about the new documents, Alster shifted gears."The Department [of Homeland Security] wishes to express concern that he did not identify himself," said Alster, referring to me. He then claimed that the "respondent," the man he was trying to deport, should be concerned about his privacy because I was in the courtroom.Judge Lyons' response to the ICE attorney was that, while the courts are considered "generally open to the public," he would inform the man whose hearing was supposed to be underway about the government’s "concerns." Lyons asked the man on the screen whether he was concerned about my presence."I don't see anything wrong with it," the man answered.Yet Alster persisted. He told the judge that information, including the man's criminal record, could end up in the newspapers. The judge relayed this claim. That prompted the man to say he was, in fact, concerned. Who wouldn't be?Judge Lyons then, reluctantly it seemed, asked everyone except family members to leave the court.I initially ignored the request from the judge, due to the fact that it wasn't an order. There hadn't been motions submitted to the court to hold a closed hearing. If the ICE attorney was genuinely concerned about anyone's privacy in that particular case, he could have submitted a motion well in advance.Judge Lyons then basically admitted he couldn't bar me from staying, but he explained that he’d have to consider canceling and rescheduling.At that point, I asked the judge to inform the man on the screen that I wasn't going to put anything about him in any newspaper, but that I would probably write about "the behavior of the ICE attorney." I then requested the judge to ask the man again if he'd be OK with me staying on those terms. The man seemed OK with this, but I got up and left the courtroom, anyway. I didn't want to be inconsiderate to him, and his family, or further delay his case.I took the elevator down to the second floor and asked for Leslie Ungerman, the chief counsel of ICE's San Francisco Field Office — and Alster's boss.Ungerman walked me into her office and heard my complaint. I told her what you read above, and also this:Earlier that morning, I had been in a different courtroom, located on the fourth floor of the DHS building on Sansome Street. Immediately when I walked into the courtroom, the ICE attorney turned and scowled at me. I took a seat and flipped open my notebook. I was the only person there besides the ICE attorney and the translator. The judge was in chambers. The image of a man in custody appeared on a screen, head down, waiting. The ICE attorney then asked me, "Are you here for a case?""No," I said. That was the truth; I was there to observe the operations of the court, not report on specific cases.The ICE attorney turned away, but seconds later he swung back around in his chair and questioned me: "Are you with anyone?"I knew what he was getting at, so I came right out and said, "I'm news media." Then I asked him, "Who are you?""Assistant chief counsel," he said in an unfriendly tone.Over the past couple months, I've experienced similar behavior from ICE attorneys, some of who seem to think it's strange that anyone would want to observe the inner workings of San Francisco's immigration courts, and who seem to be hostile to the presence of a journalist.After listening to my concerns about the conduct of two of her ICE attorneys, Ungerman told me that court proceedings are open to the public and that the Department of Homeland Security wants to be transparent. She said, however, that Alster's effort to have me removed from court was likely her fault.Ungerman explained how, last week, she held a meeting with her attorneys to go over what she said were recently raised concerns involving privacy, the news media, and potential safety issues in the courts. She said that, in some cases, there is sensitive information discussed during hearings, including criminal histories. In the past, she added, some people have complained that information about them was made public, and that a judge never asked them if they wanted a closed hearing.Ungerman basically said her office is trying to protect the privacy of the people they're simultaneously prosecuting, people who tend to not have an attorney of their own.I've covered many different state and federal courts as a reporter. I've followed cases involving closed hearings, sealed documents, and complex privacy issues. But I have never before had a prosecuting attorney demand that I identify myself in a court hearing that was open to the public. And I've never seen a prosecutor offer legal advice about privacy to the person he's prosecuting in an attempt to expel a suspected reporter from the courtroom.But to be honest, I've never seen anything like San Francisco's immigration courts.Last year, the first time I tried to attend court at the DHS building at 630 Sansome Street, a private guard with Paragon Systems, which contracts with the government to secure the building, told me I wasn't allowed inside unless I had "an appointment" or "official business" of some kind. I informed him I was a newspaper reporter and that I wanted to observe court hearings. That was my official business, I said. He claimed this wasn't permitted and then directed me out of the building.The first time I tried entering the immigration courts in the DHS offices at 100 Montgomery Street, another security guard told me I could only pass through security if I was there for a specific court hearing involving myself or a family member.Needless to say, I kept going back. But it's clear that San Francisco's immigration courts have a problem with transparency.Whatever the outcome of the leadership election, we know that there will be many in our party who are disappointed with the result. Someone winning inevitably means that others will have lost.
While on a school field trip to a candy factory, Butters spots actor Tom Cruise working there, packing fudge into boxes. Stan, who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in "Trapped in the Closet", accidentally insults him again by calling him a "fudge packer", as Cruise claims to be fly fishing. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a class action lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father Randy to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet Muhammad. This causes an uproar because depictions of Muhammad are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the Super Best Friends, a squad of superhero-like religious figures (Jesus Christ, Gautama Buddha, Moses, Krishna, Laozi, Joseph Smith) of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his "goo", as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with "goo" in "Butt Out", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's "goo" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.
By this time, Cartman arrives with "Mitch Conner", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a ventriloquist act. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a U-Haul truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the Ginger Kids, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.
Stone said in writing the episode, they were determined not to produce a clip show, but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode.[2] Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just "rehashing a bunch of old stuff".[6][7] In honor of the 200th episode, the website SouthPark200.com was launched, offering a forum to fans to post their congratulations to South Park and view those posted by others. Various people have contributed to the site, including the creators of the animated series The Simpsons (who used the opportunity to revisit another previous South Park theme, the episode "Simpsons Already Did It", saying "We already [produced 200 episodes]. Twice."[8]), members of the rock band Rush and Denver Nuggets basketball player Chauncey Billups. The site also includes congratulations from All in the Family creator Norman Lear, who guest-starred in the 100th episode "I'm a Little Bit Country", and figure skater Brian Boitano, who was featured in the song "What Would Brian Boitano Do?" in the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.[9]
"200" features jokes and references to past South Park episodes, storylines, characters and controversies.[2][6][10] The episode revolves heavily around efforts to bring Muhammad into public view. This is based on two past controversies in 2005 (Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy) and 2007 (Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists. As a result of those incidents, many publications and television studios have refused to broadcast images of Muhammad whatsoever, which was the inspiration behind Tom Cruise's efforts to harvest Muhammad's apparent immunity to satire and ridicule.[11][12][13] Parker and Stone addressed the Muhammad issue in their two-part tenth season episode "Cartoon Wars", during which they attempt to show an image of the prophet, only to reveal that Comedy Central has forbidden any such image from being broadcast on their network. However, Muhammad had already been featured on-screen in the fifth season episode "Super Best Friends", in which he is among a band of religious figures modeled after the superheroes in the Super Friends cartoons from the 1970s and 1980s. (The Super Best Friends are featured once again in "200".) The episode "Super Best Friends" aired in 2001, before the Jyllands-Posten and Vilks controversies. Stan makes reference to that past use of Muhammad's image in "200" by saying of Muhammad, "I saw him once...a while ago..."[6][14] This reference was purposely included to reflect the irony that an image that was previously not a problem had suddenly become an issue due to new circumstances. Stone said, "Something that was OK is now not OK, and that's just fucked up."[2] The "Super Best Friends" episode continues to be run uncensored by Comedy Central in repeats, even though new images of Muhammad remained prohibited.[2]
Additionally, Muhammad has long been featured as one of the many characters shown in an image of dozens of South Park residents during the show's opening credits. That image, however, has gone largely unnoticed, and thus has not drawn much controversy.[14] When asked whether they feared retribution for mocking Muhammad, Parker said, "We'd be so hypocritical against our own thoughts, if we said, 'Okay, well let's not make fun of them because they might hurt us. Okay, we'll rip on the Catholics because they won't hurt us, but we won't rip on [Muslims] because they might hurt us.'"[2][14] The Muhammad subplot in "200", like the "Cartoon Wars" episodes, advocates for free speech and speaks out against censorship, both of Muhammad's image and any subject considered taboo.[6][15] "200" also demonstrates the double standard in the handling of offensive images of Muhammad and other religious figures, particularly in the scene in which Muhammad is censored altogether, but Buddhism founder Gautama Buddha is shown snorting cocaine in front of the South Park children.[6][15] The extreme measures the South Park boys go to in order to conceal Muhammad, like hiding him in a window-less truck and dressing him as a mascot, demonstrate the absurdity of the fear in showing the prophet, as does the fear of retaliation that the South Park residents show after Randy draws a stick figure-like drawing of him, which is not censored.[15]
During one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior.[11] In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.[12] A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should "just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already".[6] Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.[6] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as "her," to which the discussion goes "her who?" "her" "oh...her." This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks "what did I ever do to you" and Rick answers "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" Steve: "her? oh...her"[citation needed][62]
On May 1, 18 days after the episode's original airdate, a failed car bomb attempt was discovered by the New York City Police Department near the eastern corner of 1 Astor Plaza in New York City, on West 45 Street, on a side street near the location of the world headquarters of Viacom, Comedy Central's parent company. Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established.[85][86] Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." However, King stressed the theory was "one possibility out of a hundred".[87] Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident. Younus Abdullah Muhammed, who runs the group's website, was in Times Square at the time speaking out against President Barack Obama with a loudspeaker. But he said of the failed car bomb, "What do you think, I commanded somebody to blow up a building in the middle of Times Square? [...] It had nothing to do with the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom."[88] NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said of the theory, "We certainly wouldn't rule that out."[89] However, media reports indicated Faisal Shahzad, the suspect arrested in connection with the attempted bombing, had trained for months prior to the first broadcast of "200."[90]
The results of this poll are more accurate than some polls reported by the media. According to a news release: Previous polling on the issue of funding Planned Parenthood has shown majority support for government funding of Planned Parenthood. But the RMU poll, conducted before a gunman killed three people at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, has a very different result: 53.3 percent support defunding Planned Parenthood, while 31.5 percent oppose it. The poll asked respondents if they would support or oppose a plan by U.S. Congressional Republicans to shift Planned Parenthood funds to community clinics that perform the same services but do not perform abortions. Just over half, 53.3 percent, strongly or somewhat support the plan while 31.5 percent are strongly or somewhat opposed. Philip Harold, RMU professor of political science, said RMU’s polls shows different results than other national polls because the question is worded more clearly. Instead of simply asking, “Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off?,” the RMU poll asked instead: “Congressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions. Would you say you support or oppose this plan?” Other results from the poll include information on the public’s knowledge of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos. Awareness is rising, the poll revealed:
The Outlaw Josey Wales was inspired by a 1972 novel by Forrest Carter, and was originally titled The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales and later retitled Gone to Texas. The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer Bob Daley at Malpaso, and Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights.[6] Michael Cimino and Philip Kaufman later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible in style and retained many of the mannerisms in Wales's character which Eastwood would display on screen, such as his distinctive lingo with words like "reckon", "hoss" (instead of "horse"), and "ye" (instead of "you") and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims.[6] The characters of Wales, the Cherokee chief, Navajo woman, and the old settler woman and her daughter all appeared in the novel.[7] On the other hand, Kaufman was less happy with the novel's political stance; he felt that it had been "written by a crude fascist" and that "the man's hatred of government was insane".[4] He also felt that that element of the script needed to be severely toned down, but, he later said, "Clint didn't, and it was his film".[4] Kaufman was later fired by Eastwood, who took over the film's direction himself.
Principal photography began on October 6, 1975 in Lake Powell.[9][8] A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regard to their emerging relationship.[10] One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned.[11] Soon after, filming moved to Kanab, Utah. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.[12] The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production.[12] Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation.[12] This resulted in the Director's Guild passing new legislation, known as 'the Eastwood Rule', which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself.[12] From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second-in-command; with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team were able to finish making the film efficiently.
One of my favorite cars of all time is the Shelby Daytona Coupe, it is not only an amazing car but one that is so great simply because it was built out of the drive and passion of competition. Shelby Daytona Coupes were entered in a number of races in 1964-65 through the British Alan Mann Racing Ford factory team, as well as a temporarily selling or leasing to other racing teams such as “Tri-Colore” of France and Scuderia Filipinetti of Switzerland. The cars were built with one purpose... to take on Ferrari and its 250 GTO in the GT classShelby Daytona Coupes raced in GT Division III, for engine displacements over 2000 cc. The Shelby Daytona Coupes, in their first year of competition, finished second (by 6 points) in GT III class for the 1964 World Sportscar Championship season. The Shelby Daytona Coupes won the GT III class (by 19 points) for the 1965 World Sportscar Championship season.A list of the Daytona's most important victories:1964 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win, Dave MacDonald/Bob Holbert)1964 24 Hours of Le Mans (GT class win, fourth overall, Dan Gurney/Bob Bondurant)1964 RAC Tourist Trophy (GT class win)1964 Tour de France Automobile (GT class win)1965 24 Hours of Daytona (GT class win)1965 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win)1965 Italian Grand Prix at Monza (GT class win)1965 Nürburgring 1000 km (GT class win)1965 12 Hours of Reims (GT class win, clinched 1965 World Sportscar Championship)1965 Enna-Pergusa (GT class win)1965 25 land speed records at BonnevilleAfter 1965 Ford focused on the GT40 program and the Daytona Coupes were retired, sold off, and some even became street cars for a time.Below are some of my favorite photos of the Daytona Coupes I have been able to photograph, many are replicas of course, but they are still incredibly special cars and always a rarity at car shows.Microsoft’s decision to wage a new war against Macs with premium Windows PCs is paying off, the company says. Thanks to high-end devices like the Surface Book and Surface Studio, Microsoft managed to steal market share from Apple last quarter.
What's next?: Butler has to continue to work on his jump shot and become more consistent from the outside. His teammates and coaches love him because of his work ethic. If he wants to improve his game he'll have to live in the gym again this summer and try to make the next step in his progression.For much of the Western world, physical pain ends with a simple pill. Yet more than half the world's countries have little to no access to morphine, the gold standard for treating medical pain.Freedom from Pain shines a light on this under-reported story. "For a victim of police torture, they will usually sign a confession and the torture stops," says Diederik Lohman of Human Rights Watch in the film. "For someone who has cancer pain, that torturous experience continues for weeks, and sometimes months on end."Unlike so many global health problems, pain treatment is not about money or a lack of drugs, since morphine costs pennies per dose and is easily made. The treatment of pain is complicated by many factors, including drug laws, bureaucratic rigidity and commercial disincentives.In India, the first stop in the film and the world's largest grower of medicinal poppy for developed countries, there are severe restrictions to the use of morphine domestically. In 27 out of 28 states in India, narcotics laws are so strict that doctors fear prescribing it, and patients literally scream for relief. Drug companies have little incentive to manufacture morphine for the domestic market because of reporting requirements and small profit margins.In the Ukraine, the film reveals that access to pain medication is halted by outdated, Soviet-style bureaucracy, arbitrary limits on doses, and a lack of oral morphine. As a result, many patients experience prolonged bouts of untreated pain, particularly in rural areas. In the Ukraine, we learn that Artur, a former decorated KGB colonel suffering from prostate cancer, sleeps with a gun under his pillow - his only way out, should he decide his pain is too great.Nadia, a single mother living in Kiev, tells of the anguish of living with a son in constant pain. Vlad, her son, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and sent home from the hospital with nothing but the meagre government dose of pain killers. Nadia recounts how his agony grew to the point where he once attempted suicide, nearly throwing himself from a fourth story window. It would be another three long years of mother and son battling with severe pain until Vlad died.Until the Ukrainian leadership acts to remove the barriers to palliative care, it falls to defiant individuals like Sergey Psiurnyk, a modern-day Robin Hood, to ensure that suffering people get the morphine they need. Riding with Psiurnyk as he makes his rounds, he says he risks years in jail to collect morphine from sick people who do not need it and deliver it to people who do.Overall, Freedom from Pain reveals that bureaucratic hurdles, and the chilling effect of the global war on drugs, are the main impediments to a pain free world. Patients will continue to suffer until global bodies actively work with countries to exclude medical morphine from the war on drugs, and change the blunt drug laws that curtail access to legitimate medical opiates worldwide. Uri Fedotov, the executive director of the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, admits in the film that the war on drugs is cutting people off from pain medication, but offers little in the way of concrete proposals for changing the status quo.Lohman points out that inertia may be the greatest obstacle to improving access to morphine, and that pressure brought by doctors and human rights activists is critical to getting pain medication to the people who need it. That is what happened in Uganda, the final stop in the film. Dr Jack Jagwe, who served in that war-torn country's health ministry in the 1990s, worked closely with foreign doctors and the international community to put into writing that every citizen there should have the right to palliative care - a first in Africa.Uganda also changed its laws to allow nurses in rural areas to prescribe morphine - another first. Today, they visit people in pain and administer liquid morphine without any doctor's involvement. Uganda is seen as a potential model for pain treatment, but most improvements around the world have been small and localised, resulting from the efforts of "enterprising entrepreneurs" like Dr M. R. Rajagopal, a pioneer of palliative care. In India, medical morphine is readily accessible only in the small state of Kerala because of his unceasing efforts.With the help of his colleagues and the cooperation of the state drug controller, Rajagopal led the push to create a streamlined operating procedure for morphine licensing in Kerala. Now patients in desperate need of pain drugs have access and doctors do not fear strict penalties. Rajagopal, who has helped create a model for the rest of India, says what is desperately needed is "systematic evaluation of the problem ... in the developing world, and an action plan aimed at overcoming it".
•Can you tell me why [Ambassador] Chris Stevens was in Benghazi that he was killed? Do you know?

Wall Street Journal leaked an internal Fed memo outlining the policy. It's not hard for central bankers to get what they want without doing anything, as long as what they want is less inflation (and that's almost always what central bankers want). They just have to wait for a recession to come along ... and then keep waiting until inflation falls to where they want it. Then, once prices have declined enough for their taste, they cut rates (or buy bonds) to stabilize inflation at this new, lower level. But it's one thing to stabilize inflation at a lower level; it's another to keep it there. The Fed has to raise rates faster than it otherwise would during the subsequent recovery to keep inflation from going back to where it was before the recession. It's what the Fed calls "opportunistic disinflation," and it's hard to believe this wasn't their strategy looking at falling inflation the previous few decades. Not that we have to guess. Fed president Edward Boehene actually laid out this approach in 1989, and Fed governor Laurence Meyer endorsed the idea of "reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle" in a 1996 speech -- the same year theleaked an internal Fed memo outlining the policy.
But it gets worse. Pushing inflation progressively lower means recoveries get progressively weaker, since the Fed has to choke off inflation, and hence the recovery, at lower and lower levels. Now, to be fair, the Fed, and Ben Bernanke in particular, have awoken to the dangers of this approach. The danger, of course, is that the Fed gets in a situation where short-term rates are stuck at zero, but the economy stays stuck in a slump. Sound familiar? Bernanke In short: Recoveries have been jobless, because that's how the Fed likes them.But it gets worse. Pushing inflation progressively lower means recoveries get progressively weaker, since the Fed has to choke off inflation, and hence the recovery, at lower and lower levels. Now, to be fair, the Fed, and Ben Bernanke in particular, have awoken to the dangers of this approach. The danger, of course, is that the Fed gets in a situation where short-term rates are stuck at zero, but the economy stays stuck in a slump. Sound familiar? Bernanke realized this was a threat in 2002 when the economy was flirting with deflation despite 1.34 interest rates, and vowed not to let it happen here. (Remember, "disinflation" means falling inflation, and "deflation" means negative inflation).
The Fed, of course, did let it happen here. But it didn't let prices actually start to fall, which would make debt and borrowing more expensive at the worst possible moment, due to the Fed's bond-buying and to wages that are sticky downwards. Bernanke got the Fed to accept that opportunistic disinflation had gone too far with QE1 and QE2, but it's not clear that he's gotten them to give up on the idea altogether . Core inflation has settled in below 2 percent, and the Fed's economic projections don't show it rising above that level anytime soon. That's pushed nominal GDP growth -- the growth of the total size of the economy -- down to 4 percent for each of the past three years; a low level the Fed is apparently comfortable with. Bernanke seems to be trying to shift the consensus towards undoing some of this disinflation -- unlike previous rounds of bond-buying, QE3 was aimed at lowering unemployment, and not stopping lower prices, while the Evans rule explicitly says the Fed will tolerate inflation up to 2.5 percent -- but there's been no shift in the data so far. The Fed needs to realize there is no try when it comes to reflation. It has to promise to do whatever it takes.
Each leaf is decorated with a black diamond set in platinum. "No one needs a guitar of that value - particularly a 19-year-old girl who is not now and never will be a professional musician and who has not had guitar lessons for some years," Mr Sanderson said. "Faced with a question about what guitar she might like she let her imagination run wild. "A 19-year-old boy in the same position would probably, when asked about a car, have nominated a Ferrari or a Lamborghini." With AAPScotland’s independence bid may have failed, but the affair revealed powerful grass-roots support for a Scottish state. Although Catalonia’s referendum on independence, originally slated for Nov. 9, has been canceled under Madrid’s opposition, Catalonians appear determined to hold some sort of vote on that date to express their sentiments anyway. Further afield, Russian speakers in Ukraine seem to have spoken their mind. Given the chance, perhaps the Basques, the Northern Irish, Flemish, Corsicans, South Tyroleans, Bosnian Serbs and others would give it a shot too. And across Europe, nationalist, anti-EU parties are on the rise, led by politicos who want beefed-up borders, fewer foreigners and more state revenue (or even territory) for their particular volk.
First, let’s take a look at nationalism itself. There are two kinds of nationalism (and nations), namely the civic and the ethnic varieties. Both herald from the time of the French Revolution of 1789, when the people of Europe began to band together with their neighbors as one (nation) to demand rights and sovereignty. At a time when kings and empires ruled the day, the nation was a new form of identity linking people who shared language, a home region and culture. This progressive, liberating nationalism laid the foundation for our modern democracies, most of which are in nation-states. Modern nationalism took two routes. One was the ethnic nation, infused with Romantic notions of seamless racial communities bound by blood, territory and destiny. In the world of ethnic nations, one nation is always superior and destined to rule over territory as well as other peoples. As intellectuals such as the British historian Eric Hobsbawm and German philosopher Hannah Arendt argued, the nativist ethnic nation was at the root of the 20th century’s terrible bloodshed. In power, ethnic nationalists inevitably pursue authoritarian courses at home and aggressive, expansionist policies abroad, like those that paved way for the century’s world wars and the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia. Civic nationalism is another story. Its members are bound by common values and political ideas, not biological or other pseudo-scientific characteristics. Civic nationalists — for example, John Stuart Mill — espouse tolerance, equality and individual rights. The civic nationalist may be proud of his nation, but not at the expense of other nations that have similar legal rights. Civic nationalism, for example, was at the heart of the Founding Fathers’ vision of the United States.
Horizontal smokers. As a rule, they are large, heavy and stable. The wood and propane types usually have at least one set of wheels and they can be wheeled into the back of a truck, on a flatbed trailer, or some even come with a built-in trailer hitch to be pulled behind a vehicle. There are very large permanent stationary smokers that can smoke a complete side of beef at one time. Some horizontal smokers are capable of smoking several hundred pounds of meat at a time, and are the best choice if you plan on smoking at large get-togethers, conventions, cook-offs, or even commercially. These are the choice of professionals. Smaller versions are made, but they are still very heavy and solid. They have offset smoke-boxes, and the fires can be kept smoldering for days and days. They are wonderful for smoking a lot of meat, but are somewhat impractical for smaller, family-size amounts. This is why most serious smokers have both types. The drawback to horizontal smokers is that they are a lot more work to clean. The only way I can get mine really clean is to take it to the car wash, with the high-pressure hot water and degreasers.
We rated their Smokey Mountain Smoker/Grills as the #1 Charcoal Smoker on the market. The Smokey Mountain Series are vertical wood/charcoal smokers, and they are available in 3 sizes, 14.5”, 18.5”, and 22.5”. These measurements are the diameters. These ultra-reliable units are outstanding for large roasts, huge turkeys, hams, briskets, and similar cuts. The 22.5” size easily smokes 2 30+ lb turkeys, or large roasts, hams, etc…at a time. In addition, it makes a great hibachi-style grill. By moving the fire bowl to the 1st grate tier, placing lava rocks on the coals, and setting a grate directly on top of the fire bowl, it even makes a wonderful brazier. They are very easy to clean and maintain, and light enough to easily take with you to the lake, river, or grandmas house for the holidays. The only con I can think of for this cooker is that it’s cooking area is too small for a large racks of ribs (unless you cut them), a side of beef, a whole hog, spreading out fish, sausages, cheeses, and such. For these, you’d need a Texas-style horizontal smoker, which is a lot heavier and harder to move around. No smoker will do everything. But for a family, this comes as close to a perfect smoker as you can get.
Now, the bad. Compared to the Weber, there are construction issues. While fully functional, the quality of construction is considerably below that of the Weber. The riveting appears a little sloppy in places. The steel is much thinner. The vent doors are made more cheaply,. The handles are cheaply made, but since they are bolted on, they could be upgraded. Heat leaks out between the sections because the metal clips do not make an airtight seal, and since they are riveted, replacement would be difficult, if not impossible. Heat also leaks out from the vent doors. All of the welded seams seem a little sloppy. There is no heat shield, so you will have to be very careful where you set the unit to use it. And lastly, it does not come with a cover. One can be purchased separately for around $30.00. However, when I tested the cover, water came in around the mesh bottom and pooled in the fire bowl. This would eventually rust out the bottom, so the unit must be stored indoors, even with the cover. These reasons are probably why the unit is only warranted for one year, vs the Weber’s 10-year warranty. Also, when I tested the thermometer in the cover (by putting the probe in boiling water…at my elevation, water boils at 205°F), it was off by 25°F.
Now for the bad. It’s a Chinese-made unit, so it is cheaply made, but fully functional for it’s intended purpose. There are no controllable vents, and no vent holes in the fire-pan, so it can clog up with ash. However, this is easily corrected by drilling 5 or 6 small holes in the bottom of the firebox, to allow more air circulation. The lid is not a snug fit, but tight enough to smoke. The access door is a little narrow, making it harder to add wood/charcoal, but still doable. The temperature gauge is a joke. It doesn’t even have any numbers on it. Just a dial of ranges that say, ” Warm, Ideal, and Hot”. I didn’t even bother testing it. The first thing I would do with this unit is replace the thermometer with a good numerical one. The cover is adequate, and kept the unit dry when tested. The worst thing is that Brinkmann Customer Service is non-existent. It is impossible to defeat their computer answering system to reach a live person. You have to leave a call-back number, which almost never results in a call-back. However, Walmart, and Home Depot both have good return policies if there is something wrong with your smoker.
This smoker is made from 18-gauge stainless steel, and feels like it could survive a direct hit from a Howitzer. It is well-insulated. The wheels roll smoothly, and moving it around was easy (one caution: you want to be sure it is on fairly level ground, or it may take off without you….the two rear casters can be locked). The drip pan slides under the smoker, and can be refilled without opening the door. The wood box is very well-built. The door has good solid latches that do not hang-up, and the door swings freely. The 12’cord was long enough, without being so long that it gets in the way. When you are carrying a heavy tray of meat, the last thing you need is a lot of loose electrical cable underfoot. Since it has wheels, it is easy to move near the electrical source. The thermometer tested to +/- 4°F, which is outstanding. I tested the insulation by heating it to 250°F, then turning it off and letting it set with the door closed. The air temperature was 54°F that day. After 20 minutes, it had only lost 10°F, which is as good a job of insulation as a lot of coolers. The smoker comes with a small bag of hickory chips for you to season it with….a nice touch. And, Smokin It’s website has a forum with all kinds of great tips, tricks, add-ons, DIY modifications, and recipes….enough to keep even a die-hard smokinero happy.
They are usually cheap and inaccurate. On an offset, the next thing I would do is plug the thermometer hole with Master Bond EP21NDFG Sealant. You need to be able to monitor the temperature at both ends of the smoker, so buy 2 new good thermometers. Next, drill 2 holes in the front facing of the smoker, about 8” from each end. Make the holes just big enough to be able to screw the new thermometers through the holes. Make the holes too big and you will have leakage. Install the thermometers. Now, you will have an accurate temperature reading on both ends of the smoker. If your smoker gets a lot hotter near the firebox than at the far end, you need to install a deflector, convection plate, or a reverse-flow duct. There are several easy ways to do this. You can make a deflector plate that channels the heat and smoke under the food by cutting a flat metal panel to size, then attaching it at a downward angle above the opening from the fire-box, to the bottom of the main chamber. This forces the heat and smoke to flow under the food before going out the chimney. I have made these successfully from an old aluminum cookie sheet, and attached it with a small self-starting set-screws.

You can easily make a “poor-mans” reverse-flow duct system in your smoker by using the above method to fashion and attach a deflector plate, then just covering the grate with aluminum foil, and punching a lot of small holes in it. This forces the smoke under the grate. As the smoke and heat rise at the far end, the top is cooler than the bottom, forcing the heat and smoke to travel back towards the fire-box (it’s complicated physics…just trust me on this…it works…), then up towards the cooler air in the top, across and out the chimney. You can also fashion a duct system by cutting old cookie sheets to the correct width, bending them to shape, and attaching them with small set-screws. Here’s how the duct system looks:
You will be playing some of the scummiest places known to humans. Beer soaked floors, toilets that haven’t been flushed since Nixon resigned, stages that are the size of pin heads and bartenders with less teeth than eyes. Given the high quality nature of these venues, don’t expect amazing sound. You’ll have to bring your own P.A. If a club says they have their own P.A., still bring yours. Their P.A. will consist of two broken mic stands, some crate P.A from the 70’s with two broken channels, a mic that smells worse than GG Allin, and speakers from a car stereo. Since great sound is what you are looking for, set up your P.A right before you are about to start. If you go on at 9PM, start to set it up at 8:57. At 9:45 when you have just finished running your last mic cable, proceed to do a sound check. The perfect thing to say into the mic “Testing, one two three.” After that say “testies, one two… three?” No one has ever heard this joke before and will know your band means business. After three hours of sound check, pack up and go get your money.
#define . This is mainly used to define constants. For instance, #define BIGNUM 1000000 specifies that wherever the character string BIGNUM is found in the rest of the program, 1000000 should be substituted for it. For instance, the statement: int a = BIGNUM; becomes int a = 1000000; #define is used in this way so as to avoid having to explicitly write out some constant value in many different places in a source code file. This is important in case you need to change the constant value later on; it's much less bug-prone to change it once, in the #define , than to have to change it in multiple places scattered all over the code. #include . This is used to access function definitions defined outside of a source code file. For instance: #include <stdio.h> causes the preprocessor to paste the contents of <stdio.h> into the source code file at the location of the #include statement before it gets compiled. #include is almost always used to include header files, which are files which mainly contain function declarations and #define statements. In this case, we use #include in order to be able to use functions such as printf and scanf , whose declarations are located in the file stdio.h . C compilers do not allow you to use a function unless it has previously been declared or defined in that file; #include statements are thus the way to re-use previously-written code in your C programs.
So climate is blood. The stylistic sign of sincerity, apart from the plain diction of common people, showed itself in a rhetorical economy: the experimental philospher must maintain "A constant Resolution to reject all the amplifications, digressions, and swellings of style; to return back to the primitive purity and shortness, when men delivered so many Things, almost in an equal number of Words." Nor was this economy merely metaphorical. One of the pragmatic purposes of the Royal Society was the improvement of manufacture; experimental philosophers were to propose better use of the new materials originating in America and elsewhere. Says Spratt "it has been the constant error of men's labours in all Ages, that they have still directed them to improve those of Pleasure, more than those of profit. . .what prodigious expense has been thrown away about the fashions of clothes? But how little endeavours have there been, to invent new materials for clothing, or to perfect those we have?" English inventiveness, plainess, reason, and sincerity made an efficient structure for the economical administration of manufacture, trade, and colonies. A formal Academy would not prove necessary. The 18th century blossoming of the sciences extended through all aspects of the political economy of the nation and its colonies, the new scientific rhetoric proving the ground for the radical nationalist literatures of the late 18th century. The public for the purified diction of Wordworth and Coleridge was already established in the late 17th century. Sincerity is a market, a decisive method, a nationalist politics, and an ethnic signifier. Lyrical Ballads are ethnic weather. They wear a blue bonnet. They read the weather signs for bombers.
The best parts of manifestoes are their lapses and practical failures. Wordsworth, in the Second Preface to Lyrical Ballads says "The language of these rustic men has been adopted. . .because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived; and because. . . being less under the influence of social vanity, they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions." Wordsworth was applying the Royal Society's notion of plain speech to poetry. The transposition of the rhetoric of sincerity from prose style to poetry wasn't entirely elided; Wordsworth stressed that good poetry and good prose have a common diction. He claimed as well that all knowledge, including the sciences, belongs in poetry. He wasn't the first to make this claim; he was reiterating an important theme in literary criticism. In the 18th century Thomas Aikens and Joseph Trapp wrote and lectured on the advisability of bringing the discourses of the new natural sciences into poetry. For these critics, the natural sciences would supply poetry with newness, variability and change-- the concern was pointed towards content. For Aikens and Trapp, the traditional form of the georgic would provide a structural ground on which descriptions of specifically english nature could unfold. The new style of descriptive rhetoric in the sciences didn't immediately replace poetic diction, but it did supplement the poem's content, previously a non-contentious iteration of classical formulations and phraseologies, with new values of authenticity and regional truth and specificity. In constituting this separation between content and form, Aiken and Trapp attributed to the poet a new agency, the potential of subjective choice. No longer genre-driven, the composition of poetry now included in its compass the possibility that content was a matter of individual choice, and the measure of the poem was no longer tradition, but authenticity. Wordsworth extended the trope from content to diction-- now the lexical choices and phrase formations enacted by the poet reflected the poets own subjective status rather than the learned apprehension of a tradition-based rhetorical economy. But Coleridge later pointed out how Wordsworth's poetry consistently exceeds its own claims for a pure diction, and accompanying proprieties of sentiment and structure, and that the poetry's value lies in the particular textures of Wordsworths transgressions of his own theory. Early 19 century scientific description also overflows its own rhetorical programme and stylistic norm. I've been monitering this overflow, specifically within the meteorological literature pertaining to clouds.
Clouds presented a specific formal difficulty to description and nomenclature-- if, as Sprat advised, the relation between objects and words should be equivalent, economical, the cloud challenged the propriety of this equivalence since its appearance as a thing was so ephemeral. In fact for a long time a cloud was not a thing. Clouds couldn't be seen for the sky. Robert Hooke, who reported to the Royal Society on A Method for Making a History of the Weather, proposed a lexicon for the sky. "But as for the faces of the sky, they are so many, that many of them want proper names. . . Let Clear signify a very clear sky. . . Checquered a clear sky with many great white round clouds. . .Hazy, a sky that looks whitish. . . Thicke, a sky more whitened. . . Overcast, when the vapours so whiten and thicken the air that the sun cannot break through" and so on, through the terms Hairy, Watered, Waved, and Lowring. The trouble with Hookes proposed diction was that it could not perceive clouds structurally, but looked at the sky as a face, a single figure to which the meteorologist could apply an interpretive phenomenology. The struggle was to see a cloud as particular, so that it could be enumerated, measured and described.
This is what dignified Howards observations: he was able to invent a structural typology which could account for change. The face of the sky was revisioned as "certain distinct modifications." The basic three cloud types corresponded to zones or depths of the sky as well as to structural types-- cirrus, to the high, fibrous wisps, Cumulus to the conical heaps of the middle ground, and stratus to the horizontal sheets of mist which hug the earth. Clouds were translated from figurations, to-- not quite objects, but objective modifications. Weather became a system. These distinctions have become so very normalized that I think we can't really understand the absolute novelty of understanding clouds in terms of structural typology. After Howard, clouds were seen for the first time. Howard's nomenclature provided a lens. It entered the public knowledge quite quickly-- and the importance of his system can be somewhat gauged by its immediate use, not only by other meteorologists, but within the literary and visual arts. After Howard, Shelley, Coleridge and Goethe wrote cloud poems. Goethe gave the cloud treatise to the German, and Danish, romantic painters. In Modern Painters, Ruskin wrote long treatises on the perspectival representation of clouds. Constable completely reassessed his representation of skies, spending a full year doing little other than outdoor cloud studies, often 3 or more in an hour, with meteorological notations scrawled on the backs. People spend their lives researching and annotating these influences. I won't. What I want to notice here, though, is how the propriety and economy of Howard's system was almost immediately bloated with a descriptive and identificatory excess, which nevertheless managed to respect his proposed typology and structure.
After Howard, individual meteorologists gravitated towards specializations in the accounts of specific cloud types-- with some this is a stated objective, with others, a discernable inflation in descriptive balance. Rev Leonard Blomefield, for example, spent 30 years in Cambridgeshire observing the stratus formation. . . His accounts are not so much remarkable for the cloud descriptions in themselves, as they are for his strangely methodical obsession with low and creeping mists. Rev. Blomefield identified with fog. He observed its formation on a large grass meadow in front of his vicarage, and when as he described "circumstances were likely to favour the formation of fogs and creeping mists," he would place, at the far end of the field, a chair and a small table supplied with thermometres, hygrometer and notebook (kept always ready in the vicarage for this use). He would sit in the meadow and observe, taking account of all that occured relating to the fogs and creeping mists, from their first appearance to their dissappearance, if they did not continue all night. He explained, in his characteristically precise yet underdetermined manner "The way in which stratus gradually spreads itself sheetlike over a meadow, or at other times extends in lines and bands from one meadow to another, is very striking." He was inspired in these observations by his colleague Mr Wells, who wrote the "Essay on Dew". Wells also observed his chosen phenomena almost every night of his adult life. He described his method-- "Upon one serene and still night I placed fresh parcels of wool upon grass every hour, and by weighing each of them found that they had attracted dew." And so on. I can't help but read into these accounts a marvelous identificatory excess-- an identification which aligns itself with a method, in all its excessiveness, and which subsequently bleeds into a rhetorical economy of description.
Thomas Ignatius Forster, writing immediately after Howard, focussed at length on the Cirrus formation. His attempts to precisely describe the cirrus cloud reflect the need to extend descriptive grammar towards a rhythmically paratactic prolixity, when the object of description itself is in a state of constant transformation. Cirrus is the most formally variable of the modifications, and in traditional weather lore tends to be referred to using various animal and plant analogies-- Mare's tail, Mackeral back, the sea tree. Forster's cirrus description, rather than carrying out Sprat's economy of a word for each thing, refers to folkloric likeness, proceeding by a figurative logic of analogy and accretion, interleaved with a discordantly geometrical diction. Here is one sentence of his cirrus: "Comoid tufts, like bushes of hair, or sometimes like erected feathers; angular flexure; streaks; recticular intersections of them. . .which look like nets thrown over the firmament; forms of arrows; stars with long fibrous tails, cyphen shaped curves, and lines with pendulous or with erect fringes, ornament the sky; still different appearances of stars and waves again appear, as these clouds change to cirrocumulus or cirrostratus, which modifications also seem to form and subside spontaneously, in different planes, and with the varied and dissimilar appearances of flocks at rest, fleeces of wool, or myriads of small specks; of long tapering columns like the tail of the great manis, or of mackeral back skies, or of striae, like the grains of wood." Forster's cloud-sentence proceeds by a series of phrasal modifications, miming the process of transmutation in the clouds themselves, even discernably within the real time of those observed fluctuations. In this instance sincerity accrues by ornament, expansion, its rhetoric stretched to the point of contusion, within the authenticating timeframe of the plein air descriptive sketch.
This book of Forsters was in the personal library of the East Anglian John Constable, a painter with a lifelong engagement with the representation of weather conditions within landscape. In 1820, shortly after the second edition of the Forster book, and the publication of Howards Climate of London, which included his theory of cloud modification and nomenclature, Constable began a two year detailed study of clouds. He produced a huge body of oil sketches on paper, executed out doors, representing cloud types in relation to larger weather patterns. This sketches, sometimes produced in 15 minute intervals throughout a series of days, serve as a sort of real time filmic meteorological sequence. On the back of each, Constable scrawled a notation of accompanying weather conditions-- for example "Sept. 10, 1821 Eleven o'clock sultry with warm gentle rain falling large heavy clouds a heavy downpour and thunder". Then, half an hour later-- "Noon, Gentle wind at west. Very sultry after a heavy shower with thunder. Accumulated thunder clouds passing slowly away to the south east. Very Bright and Hot. All the foliage sparkling." But similarily to the way these small scale sky sketches served as reference for the later representation of skies in his fullsize canvases, the brief weather annotations sometimes extended to full length descriptions with stylistic parallels to the prolix meteorological literature he perferred:
The whole concept of government debt in the US, whether it’s federal, state, municipal, corporate or personal stands on very shaky ground. Debt is serviced with revenues and income and when both are falling it is difficult to service. We have begun to enter a period of slowly rising interest rates. In the US the Fed has managed interest rates to be as low as possible to both aid in a recovery and to keep the financial edifice from collapsing. Over the past six months the bench mark 10-year Treasury note yield has risen from a yield of 2.20% to 2.74% and presently stands at about 3.60%. That 1.4% rise in rates has been offset by GDP growth of 3%. The problem is that such GDP growth has been maintained by growth in debt. The two sources of debt are the Fed and government. The Fed has been buying the government debt by creating money out of thin air. That is called monetization and it causes inflation. The government demand comes from revenues that have fallen and continue to fall, and as a result government issues more debt. The lenders, the bond buyers, sell dilution in the value of debt and in the dollar and as a result demand a higher yield. At this stage you can see how important QE1 and 2 and fiscal stimulus have been over the past 2-1/2 years. Had they not been implemented the economic and financial system would have collapsed. The next question to be asked is will we have to have quantitative easing and stimulus indefinitely? The answer is yes, but unfortunately if that path is followed lenders will demand ever-higher interest rates and the dollar will continue to fall in value versus gold and silver and other currencies. We estimate GDP growth to be 2% to 2-1/4% in 2010, down from 3%, all of which were aided by quantitative easing, the creation of money and credit and fiscal stimulus the result of debt. Without these props there would have been little or no growth, and fairly quickly the economy would have faltered. That would have brought about a classical purge accompanied by a deflationary depression. There will soon come a time the creation of money and credit and fiscal stimulus will no longer work and the system will finally fail. That is inevitable. That will begin to happen when interest rates are rising faster than growth rates. Once that condition exists there is no further hope of servicing debt or creating more debt, because there will be no natural buyers and inflation will be raging if not hyperinflation. The US is not the only country staring into this abyss; most countries around the world have the same problem.
A product of these conditions is a perpetuation of unemployment, which we believe is 22.6% presently, for years into the future. In addition, we have had 20 years of free trade, globalization, offshoring and outsourcing that has lost America 8.5 million good paying jobs and the loss of 42,400 businesses. We have extended unemployment, but every month millions fall off leaving them on their own and food stamps. These transfer payments make up 20% of household income, which is also unsustainable. Our guess is that the current extended benefits will be extended further in spite of a projected $1.6 trillion deficit. Political types prefer an extension to revolution, but the cost is more debt, a falling dollar and rising gold and silver prices. In addition, an end to extended benefits will sap consumption that must be maintained at 70% of GDP in order to keep the economy from failure. Do not forget the US is not the only country with debt problems. In the same league are Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, Spain, Italy, England and above all Japan, which is more than 200% and growing exponentially. None of these countries are capable of growing out of their debt problems and thus, eventually we see a multilateral default of debt, which will probably entail a 2/3’s write off of debt. A jubilee of sorts.
If stabilization and growth have to be based on continued creation of money and credit and monetization then the system has to eventually collapse. It is no more a solution than extended unemployment benefits, federal government spending and hiring and food stamps. It throws the problems into the future at a terrible cost. In spite of this largess unemployment won’t improve and the monetary and fiscal effect on the economy will lesson. We call it the law of diminishing returns. Last year we saw 3% growth, or so we are officially told, and this year we believe it will be about 1% less at 2% to 2-1/4%. The effectiveness of the policy is losing momentum and strength. The next question is will a $1.7 trillion QE3 with $850 billion in additional fiscal spending be able to maintain 1% growth. Our answer is we do not think so. This fading monetary and fiscal policy will be accompanied by ever falling government revenues, unless ever more debt is created. Are you getting the feeling that governments are running around in circles with no solution in sight? If you are you are correct. The only answer is to purge the system and the sooner the better. The longer the problems are extended and individuals will be faced with unemployment and under employment and that means borrowing and the use of credit cannot be extended and that means the economy cannot grow. Even if spending cuts and higher taxes were implemented the economic and financial affects would not be felt for 6 months to a year. Government has waited too long.
We have written about rising interest rates in the whole spectrum of government and corporate bonds. The average has been 100% to 150%. Official rates have been raised in Brazil, India and China. In the US, bond buyers have already been pricing in yield increases, which they feel are necessary to offset inflation losses. Unfortunately for buyers they have not gotten nearly enough yield to compensate and are losing money on return and currency depreciation versus other currencies, but particularly versus gold and silver. In order to offset real losses, real yields will have to rise and they will. The first stop for the US 10-year note should be a move upward from 3.60% to 4% to 4.25%. That should happen this year. The next move in 2012 should be to 5% to 5.60% and the second move from 5.60% to about 7%. Mind you these are very conservative estimates. Any recovery in housing will be impossible with prices falling another 15% to 20%. Anyone with an ARM will be a dead duck. That means about a 60% plus failure rate. Bumping along the bottom could take 8 to 30 years and as we mentioned before government could end up with most of the housing eventually causing a process of nationalization.
These higher rates, which are inevitable, will raise havoc on the Federal budget and its debt service. Average maturities are 4.5 years – a very foolish move that began some 15 years ago. This means even if taxes are raised and the budget deficit cut, they will only serve as a damper on costs, which would lead to dollar depreciation and default. Worse yet, who will want to buy bonds and in particular US dollar denominated bonds as gold and silver are soaring and profits are falling along with the stock market? The Fed is buying and monetizing at least 80% of treasuries now. That means they will have to buy them all, including some from nations such as China, Japan and Middle Eastern owners. Long-term bond holders will be looking at 30% losses and the stock market 50% plus losses. The monetization process at this point will produce inflation from 14% to 40%, which could well be accompanied by hyperinflation. That hyperinflation could come quickly once inflation passes 14-3/8%, which it officially hit in 1980. At that time 30-year T-bond rates were more than 20%. We do not know exactly what the numbers will be, but we do know they will be terrible. Some time along the way the US will be forced to default and then China will own a goodly part of the US. We also believe that a major world war will be in progress. Again as a diversion from the massive economic and financial problems plus revolutions worldwide, which could short circuit having another world war. We do not know how these events will roll out, but we do know they are probable.
We ask that the Canadian Government finally face reality and recognise that the commercial seal hunt is not in any way beneficial. It does not help Canada’s wildlife, environment, reputation or even its fish stocks. We ask that the commercial harp seal hunt ends in 2012. We the undersigned ask that the Canadian Government cease the commercial harp seal hunt. Whether or not seals did once pose a threat to fish stocks, the species is now suffering the effects of climate change and overpopulation is certainly not an issue.In 2011, an estimated 80% of that year's seal pups failed to survive simply because of decreasing sea ice. With harp seals now struggling to cope with new threats, a cull is completely unnecessary and could tip the populations of a once common species over the edge.We ask that the Canadian Government finally face reality and recognise that the commercial seal hunt is not in any way beneficial.

Amna al-Qubaisi won the UAE's Rotax Max Challenge karting championship last month, and now will move on to the Formula 4 championship with the Prema team next season.Ultimately, the young Emirati driver is setting her sights on the top prize in motor sports - a seat in Formula 1."It feels really amazing to be the first female driver of the UAE to be racing in Formula 4," Amna said, according to website 360 Sport."I feel very confident that I can do well there and this is the first step to Formula 1... I hope I can live up to the expectations of Daman Speed Academy - where I have trained - and of course Abu Dhabi Racing who have placed so much trust in me."If she did make it all the way to Formula 1, Qubaisi would be one of only of six women to compete at the sport's highest levels. Only two women have ever qualified to begin a Grand Prix race.Given her young age and obvious skill on the track, motorsports journalists believe there is no reason Qubaisi can't make it.She has already taken to Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina racetrack to try out her single-seater, Kaspersky Lab-sponsored racing car and hopes it will take her to victory next season."I've tested the car at Yas Marina Circuit and in Dubai and hope to get good results. My karting experience will help me - Formula 4 is a different strategy but I was within the pace when I tested," she told the UAE-based website."Prema are a great team who have delivered champions. Moreover, Kaspersky Lab has come on board to sponsor the first ever female Emirati driver at this level of racing, which is fantastic."Qubaisi will compete in 12 races around the world during the championship, including in her native UAE - where she is guaranteed to have strong support from the local crowd.Nicknamed "The Flying Girl", Qubaisi has the backing of her father, Khaled al-Qubaisi, who is the founder of Daman Speed Academy and managing director at Abu Dhabi Racing He has high hopes for his daughter and is confident she will progress to the most competitive grades of motorsport.BERKELEY, Calif.—Days after a group of concerned professors raised alarm bells over a new network monitoring system installed at the University of California, Berkeley and the other nine campuses of the University of California system, a separate committee of system-wide faculty has now given its blessing. Some Berkeley faculty remain concerned that their academic freedom has been threatened by the new full packet capture system that sits on each campus network’s edge, however. They say that retaining such information could be used as a way to constrain legitimate discussion or research on controversial topics.
The concern has extended beyond academia as well: Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) who represents western Los Angeles—including UCLA—has weighed in. Lieu is one of a handful of a computer science majors in Congress, and he is also a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force Reserves.A suspect was killed in an officer-involved shooting in the Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles, and video shows the deadly confrontation.Authorities say officers responded to a robbery call around noon Sunday in the 500 block of San Pedro Street. When the officers came in contact with the suspect, an altercation occurred."The preliminary investigation revealed that during that altercation, at least one less than lethal device, a Taser, was deployed. However, at this time, we still do not know if that Taser did strike the suspect," said LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery.Officers continued to struggle with the suspect, and then an officer-involved shooting happened. In the video shot by Anthony Blackburn, someone yells "drop the gun" just before shots were fired.The suspect, who was identified by witnesses as "Africa", was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead."Instead of handcuffing the guy, they straight out shot him," said eyewitness Larry Jackson.Yolanda Young said she was in the area visiting a friend when she saw the confrontation near the Union Rescue Mission."Three cops tased him. He went down to the ground. Next thing I know, he got up, he's swinging on the police," Young said. "They (were) fighting with him, wrestling with him ... They pulled out their guns and they shot him five times."Three officers, one of whom is a sergeant, shot the man as they struggled on the ground for control of one of the police officer's weapons, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said."Anytime we have an officer-involved shooting and there's a loss of life, people are upset and justifiably so," Smith said. "Nobody out there, no police officer out there, wants to be involved in a situation like this where you have to take someone else's life."The three officers who opened fire have since been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.People in the crowd were heard on the video saying the man was not armed, but police say they have not yet determined if the suspect was armed.People on Skid Row who knew Africa say he wasn't violent."What did he do? He wasn't an aggravated person. He wasn't mad all the time. He just had mental problems," said Steven Tugmon.L.A. Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson and other city civil rights leaders called the L.A. Police Commission to hold a special hearing on the use of force by officers in Skid Row encounters Sunday."The killing of a homeless man identified as 'Africa' underscores the need for the police commission to hold a special hearing to fully examine police tactics and training in the use of deadly force by LAPD officers involving Skid Row residents many of whom have major mental challenges," said Hutchinson. "The special hearing would be an unprecedented effort by the commission to set a firm protocol and standard LAPD officers use to minimize the use of deadly force in encounters on skid row."Smith said at least one of the officers was also wearing a body camera. A local homeless shelter may have also captured the incident on surveillance video.Police Commission President Steve Soboroff said the independent inspector general and the district attorney have begun investigating. Anyone who witnessed the incident was urged to call the LAPD.In March of 2007, former FBI agent and freelance investigator Robert Levinson traveled to the Iranian island of Kish, a resort hangout for smugglers and various dubious characters as well as tourists – and promptly vanished. For years, the US government stoutly maintained Levinson was on a private business trip, but now it turns out he was on a mission launched by a "rogue" CIA unit to gather intelligence about the "corruption" of moderate Iranian leader and former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
I don’t know who the Illicit Finance Group was working for, but it wasn’t the US government. And I would just add this: the efforts of Levinson’s family and friends to discover his whereabouts and secure his release have employed the assistance of some of the world’s most dubious characters, whose dubiousness is all of the same color. The New York Times reports they enlisted Boris J. Birshstein, a Russian organized crime figure who had fled to Israel and then on to Canada. In 1995, Birshstein reportedly set up a week-long "summit" for big time Russian Mafia chiefs in Tel Aviv. Another major player in this campaign: Oleg Deripaska, the "aluminum czar" of Russia whose organized crime contacts have kept him from entering the United States – except for two visits in 2009, which the FBI allowed in exchange for his alleged help in locating Levinson. Deripaska wanted a deal whereby he would aid the effort on Levinson’s behalf in exchange for being allowed to enter the US. During his 2009 visit, Deripaska took the opportunity to meet with Goldman-Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, but in the end the State Department prevailed over the Justice Department and Deripaska remains persona non grata in the US.
Of course, even just “learning” or “reading about” these game design principles, and understanding them on an intellectual level, doesn’t necessarily cement them as an able tool in your tool kit. You have to apply the principle, work with it, and understand it at its essence so you can see the ways in which it is pliable. You have to feel the truth of the concept on an empathic level; every principle applies ultimately in some way to the experience of the player, and you have to strive to cultivate not just an intellectual, but a feeling sense of empathy with the way the principle impacts the player. To do this itself requires an open mind. To see that you have to do this is the first step and requires an extraordinarily open mind. Many people take it as a given that they are doing this implicitly, but unless you thoroughly check and inspect all of your assumptions, you may be following an instinct to serve the experience that is better for you as a player, and you don’t necessarily comprehensively represent the intended audience. And so when you start play-testing your games, be a social scientist, and make your play-test session about understanding your game better and understanding people better, not about getting a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” on your game. Don’t go into a play-test session unconsciously seeking the comfort of “good feedback.” Even more dangerous than the unconditionally positive reviews from friends, is the feedback from your “pretty smart friends who are avid gamers and think they understand game design, but don’t have a clue.” Again, it sounds harsh—but the gaming world is filled to the brim with very intelligent people who actively think they understand enough about how games work to give feedback about their experience but don’t, and they will confidently give you misinformation.
In addition to reading game design theory and making games on their own, the third thing I always tell game designers to do to work on their game design career is to pay attention to their own experience while they’re gaming. Remember, the game designer is crafting a specific experience for you, but they’re not necessarily trying to have that experience describe its inner workings to you. Your job as a game designer is to step outside of the immersion of the experience and observe yourself having the experience. Actually getting in touch with the experience you yourself are having is the best way to really understand it on a deep level. Normally, you get to the boss of a stage in some video game, and you’re focused on one goal: dealing enough damage to that sucker before he envelops you in fireballs. By default, you don’t have enough mental bandwidth to devote to self-examination. You’ve got a full mental plate of timing jumps and aiming your weapon. But you need to play with a new attitude. First thing is to notice your enjoyment, that you’re making a conscious choice to play this game. You may notice that you enjoy this boss fight. Then to go a little deeper, you note that you’re excited, maybe you feel some tension, and that’s why you’re having fun. Then you figure out why you feel that way, it’s because if you die you’ll have to start over, which would suck, so it’s creating a tension and an excitement. You also remember that if you win you’ll progress, maybe get a reward, a new story beat, and that is also contributing to the excitement. Then you realize that you just learned that tension is probably the single most important emotional component to many different types of game, and that a situation with two highly polarized outcomes both seeming possible in a given moment is the best surefire way to create tension, which means you just learned something really important about game design!
By Greg Stobart Ajax star Jan Vertonghen has described Tottenham as an “amazing club” and spoken of his desire to play in the Premier League next season.understands Spurs are leading a host of English clubs in the race to sign Vertonghen and held talks with Ajax over a move for the £10 million-rated defender in January.Spurs boss Harry Redknapp was in the stands to watch Vertonghen during Ajax’s Europa League clash against Manchester United on Thursday night - and the 24-year-old made it clear after the game that he would welcome a move to White Hart Lane.“I think Tottenham are an amazing club and you see how well they are doing this season,”Vertonghen told Goal.com. “They are in the top three in England and that’s where I want to play.“I can’t say anything about whether there has been contact about a transfer but I think my game can be suited to English football.“I love the atmosphere and it has the best players in the world, it breathes football. It’s one of my goals to play in the best leagues and against the best players.“It’s the only competition I watch apart from Barcelona.”Vertonghen, the Ajax captain, is also a target for Newcastle United and Arsenal while Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is a long-term admirer.The versatile defender admits his international team-mates - including City captain Vincent Kompany and Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen - are constantly in his ear trying to influence his decision on his future.“A lot of my colleagues from the national team play here and some are calling me to come,” Vertonghen added.“It’s a beautiful competition, the best in my opinion. I hope one day I can play in the Premier League with this atmosphere.“To play for a team in the Premier League would be amazing and that’s what I am going for.“It’s flattering to be linked with clubs, the rumours give me confidence but I just try to do my best every game.”One player who is unlikely to sway Vertonghen’s thoughts is Belgium team-mate Eden Hazard, the £30m-rated Lille star who is also a target for Tottenham.Vertonghen admits it would be “nice” to play with Hazard but the two are not close friends as the Ajax man speaks Flemish and does not communicate with the winger in the same language.“I read that Tottenham might sign Eden Hazard,” Vertonghen said. “It would be nice to play with him but he speaks a different language to me. He speaks French.”While Vertonghen is almost certain to leave Ajax this summer, he believes another Premier League target, Christian Eriksen, should stay at the Amsterdam ArenA for another season.The Dane has been linked with a number of leading European clubs including Manchester United but Vertonghen has urged the playmaker not to rush into a hasty exit.“Maybe for Christian it’s better to stay one more year and he can learn something, be the leader in the field for Ajax one day,” Vertonghen added. “I hope he stays one more year at least.“Christian is a clever guy and he will leave at the right moment.”Everyone knows corporations are evil, not to be trusted, and are completely willing to kill on a whim, but we don’t expect them to be so brazen about it. We want their decisions, especially the ones where they show they don’t care about their customers or the law, to be made behind closed doors, not in public view so we can make a list about them.
Repair firm iFixit has started its traditional disassembly of Apple's latest iOS device, revealing a few new components designed to fit within the tight constraints of a 6.1mm-thick chassis.As announced by Apple last week , the new Air 2 comes with a 9.7-inch laminated touch panel, A8X SoC, 8MP rear-facing camera, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Touch ID fingerprint reader. The shell was also redesigned, seeing the deletion of the orientation lock/mute button and minor aesthetic modifications to the speaker grille and volume control buttons.Today's teardown finally put a number on battery capacity, with the Air 2 sporting a 27.62 watt hour, 7,340mAh dual-cell unit, down from last year's 32.9 watt-hour configuration. According to Apple, that will get you about 10 hours of continuous use per charge, or 9 hours on the Wi-Fi + Cellular model.Also new is the Touch ID home button, which appears to share a design similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The module itself is manufactured by NXP. Touch ID is a major addition to the iPad lineup as it enables Apple Pay purchases, though without an NFC chip, payments are limited to online payments.Finally, the Air 2 features redesigned speakers, repositioned Wi-Fi antennas (located at the top-edge of the Wi-Fi model), dual ambient light sensors and dual microphones, all arranged on variety of customized flex cables.GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The Wildcat formation was a couple of weeks in the making, but Green Bay Packers receiver Randall Cobb had angled for it his whole NFL career.

(The above was written in the summer of 2009–I’ve made a few edits to bring us to date, I’m not well so it’s easier to start with a piece that’s been written and add to it. But the immediate above paragraph needs explanation–at the time it was written I thought the withdrawal was going faster and that my withdrawal would be done in the summer. I’ve since become extremely ill and my mood is hardly good as a result. One might call it “psychiatric” if they didn’t know anything about the physical hell that is withdrawal, but knowing what I know about people detoxing from benzos, even people who’ve never had a psychiatric diagnosis or symptoms prior to their use, I know that what I’m dealing with is detox. It’s hell. I can’t leave the house. I often can’t leave my room or my bed. I have pain of every imaginable kind. Hence, I’m not happy. No. It sucks….here is a man whose story I relate to. He cold -turkeyed and it took him two years to start functioning again. Though my behavior is not all the same as his, the feelings behind it are familiar at this point. I’ve got off 6 drugs in 6 years and the last 3 years have been downhill, the last 6 months I could not have conceived of before living them. I can hope I get better sooner than he did since I didn’t cold-turkey, but it certainly begs the question if slower is better. Though I personally can’t go faster and know I’ve done the right thing for me as horrible as it’s been.)
: Iron Browser is Chromium based and promises to keep your data secure through all of the usual methods. They were some of the first people to call out this notion that Chrome calls home to Google all the time (which it does, but only if you allow it to or enable features that do so), and they promised to be Chrome with all the Google stuff stripped out. The reality wasn't so pretty—they're supposedly open source (but haven't released their source for years), and the browser doesn't really offer much you can't get by tightening down Chrome's own privacy features on your own. We can't recommend it, and you can read more about it in this old post about how Iron got its start, and this post about its supposed "tracking protection." White Hat Aviator: Aviator has been heralded by some testers as "the most secure browser," even though it's both closed source (but based on Chromium, which is open source) and for a long time was only available on OS X. Aviator does have a lot to like—it defaults to Incognito mode, includes tools like Disconnect to block malicious ads and third-party tracking, blocks plugins like Flash until you enable them, defaults to DuckDuckGo instead of Google, and so on. On its face, that's all great—but again, it's nothing you can't do on your own, and as this Reddit thread notes, the browser has some serious issues. Some of those issues are technical, others are based on trust. Overall, it may be worth a shot, but you could roll your own Aviator so easily (and it offers less than some of the others above offer) that we can't really recommend it.
Starting off the countdown to Spider-Man: Homecoming is this Toys R Us exclusive 2-pack: Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Our first ever, Mary Jane Watson Marvel Legends figure, this two pack was a sure purchase for fans of Spidey. The first thing to note is how great the figures look in box. They are the perfect size to fit in your collection or on a shelf and are scaled perfectly for display. Let’s start off with taking a look at Peter Parker’s red-headed romance: Mary Jane Watson. The costume design they decided to go for was Mary Jane Watson’s first full appearance in ASM #42. Leading with her infamous line of “Face it tiger…you just hit the jackpot”, Mary Jane Watson has been as essential of a character to the Spider-Man lore as the Peter Parker himself. The design team did a great job with the hair, eye color design, and freckles for this sculpt. Where Mary Jane Watson might be lacking is in her expression. More stoic and less care-free/flirtatious as her usual portrayal, this figure captures less of that fun side of MJ and more of her serious side. The other thing to note about MJ is just the lack of accessories that came with her figurine. Even if MJ is not necessarily a heavily accessorized character in the Marvel world, her action figure would have benefited from an additional head swap or an extra coat instead of just a purse. The Spider-Man suit featured in this two pack is based on the new series that began in 2015. The Amazing Spider-Man was renumbered, beginning in 2015, and written by Spider-scribe Dan Slott. The great thing about these new ASM issues were the covers drawn by artist Alex Ross. These covers really highlighted the look to his new suit and glowing spider eyes and symbol. As mentioned before, the suit design is based off of this new series but the body sculpt looks to be new and improved. The accessories that comes with this figure are 2 sets of interchangeable hands as well as an alternate masked head. In contrast to MJ, the designers were able to capture that subtle Parker smirk in his head design. As a TRU exclusive this figure is a great homage to the recognizable romance between Mary Jane Watson and Peter Parker. TRU seems to be going with a central theme for these two-pack releases as the next set, to be released this summer, is the Phoenix and Cyclops two-pack. This was a great figure to hunt for and is still sought out weeks after it’s release. As the only MJ figure currently out in the Marvel Legends line, it makes for a worthy purchase for any Spider-Man collector. Now the only way that Hasbro can improve upon their Legends game is by creating a Spider-Man and MJ wedding variant for next year’s release. Spread the word and let’s get this made!
Long wait: Police say Jimmy Lee Dykes likely had supplies in his shelter to last weeks or months. He had previously spent eight days in the bunker At the funeral service, the bus driver was described as 'an angel who is watching over,' the little boy saiid Dale County School Superintendent Donny Bynum - as he read three letters from students who had been driven by Poland. 'You didn't deserve to die but you died knowing you kept everyone safe,' one child wrote. The FBI said that on Sunday the kidnapped boy had requested Cheez-Its and a red Hot Wheels car, both of which were delivered to the bunker the day before the successful raid. Authorities said they were also delivering medicine and other comfort items, and that Dykes had been making the child as comfortable as possible. Gathered: The world's media surrounded the scene of the shooting and hostage taking in Alabama Mission: Before today's resolution Law enforcement officials worked the scene of the hostage crisis to try and encourage Dykes to release Ethan peacefully Mel Adams, a Midland City Council member who has known Dykes since they were ages 3 and 4, said Dykes is estranged from his family.
Neighbors described Dykes as a man who once beat a dog to death with a lead pipe, threatened to shoot children for setting foot on his property, and patrolled his yard at night with a flashlight and a firearm. Vigil: Mileah Lomaneck and Whitley Riley light candles during a candlelight vigil honoring bus driver Poland as they prayed for a peaceful end to the hostage situation over the weekend His neighbor Michael Creel said Dykes had an adult daughter, but the two lost touch years ago. According to Creel, his property has a white trailer that Dykes said he bought from FEMA after it was used to house evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. The property also has a steel shipping container in which Dykes stored tools and supplies. Creel said he helped Dykes with supplies to build the bunker and has been in it twice, adding that Dykes wanted protection from hurricanes. "He said he lived in Florida and had hurricanes hit. He wanted someplace he could go down in and be safe," Creel said. Authorities say the bunker is about 6 feet by 8 feet, and the only entrance is a trap door at the top. Such bunkers are not uncommon in rural Alabama because of the threat of tornadoes. xxxxxxxxxx
An unusual coalition of activists and organizations have united in the hopes of defending Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) in his June 24 runoff against state Sen. Chris McDaniel (R-Miss.). As the Clarion-Ledger reported Tuesday, James “Scooby Doo” Warren, a Democratic political operative, says he is working with the Mississippi Conservatives PAC on a statewide plan to turn out votes for Cochran. Meanwhile, Bishop Ronnie Crudup, Sr. of the New Horizon Church in Jackson is affiliated with a super PAC called “All Citizens For Mississippi” that has run advertisements and distributed pro-Cochran fliers. The newly-formed PAC shares an address and chief financial officer with the church, raising questions about whether the church is illegally participating in the campaign. Crudup, who is African-American, told the Associated Press earlier this month that he voted for Cochran in the primary and that he felt his group “couldn’t sit on the sideline” in the runoff. “We recognized that Mississippi is a red state and more than likely will have a Republican senator, and therefore this decision, which is going to affect every citizen in Mississippi, is going to be made in the Republican primary,” Crudup said. “We therefore determined that we couldn’t sit on the sideline, but that we had to take some actions that spoke to our community about our self-interest when it comes to this race.”
History has not been kind to the legacy of William Graham Sumner. In his time (1840-1910), Sumner was one of the most prestigious and widely read libertarian intellectuals in the United States. Beyond his more technical academic work Sumner also wrote passionately and voluminously in defense of laissez faireon a wide range of social issues. His popular critique of protectionism, "The –ism Which Teaches that Waste Makes Wealth" (1885) and his denunciation of imperialism in "The Conquest of the United States by Spain" (1898) are two of his most impressive polemical works. Sumner's most sustained investigation of questions of economic policy and distributive justice appeared in a collection essays What Social Classes Owe to Each Other (1883) which includes his most famous single essay – "The Forgotten Man" (1884). Unfortunately, Sumner's intellectual legacy suffered essentially the same fate as that of his contemporary Herbert Spencer, and for much the same reason. From near-ubiquity and respectability, Sumner's ideas have descended into obscurity and disrepute. To the extent he is remembered at all today, it is mostly for his alleged "social Darwinism." In this essayMatt Zwolinski, professor of philosophy at the University of San Diego, examines the charge of social Darwinism, and, more generally, the nature of Sumner's views on redistribution and our responsibilities toward the poor and vulnerable, and concludes that the charge of social Darwinism is mistaken as applied to Sumner, who is a principled libertarian, not a social Darwinist. Moreover, he is a libertarian who took special pains to demonstrate the ways in which a regime of liberty is especially beneficial to society's most vulnerable members. Matt is joined in the dicussion by Phillip W. Magness, a historian based in the Washington, D.C. region, Robert Leroux, professor of sociology at the University of Ottawa, Fabio Rojas, professor of sociology at Indiana University, and David M. Hart, the Director of the Online Library of Liberty Project.
History has not been kind to the legacy of William Graham Sumner. In his time (1840-1910), Sumner was one of the most prestigious and widely read libertarian intellectuals in the United States. A professor of political and social science at Yale, Sumner was one of the founding figures in the academic discipline of sociology. And his most famous and enduring work, Folkways (1906), is still regarded as an important sociological exploration of cultural norms and institutions that, along the way, develops important insights into the theory of spontaneous order. Beyond his more technical academic work, however, Sumner also wrote passionately and voluminously in defense of laissez faireon a wide range of social issues. His popular critique of protectionism, "The –ism Which Teaches that Waste Makes Wealth" (1885) and his denunciation of imperialism in "The Conquest of the United States by Spain" (1898) are two of his most impressive polemical works. In 1883 he published a series of 11 short essays on the relations between workers and employers in Harper's Weekly. These essays were later republished as What Social Classes Owe to Each Other (1883), a book that represents Sumner's most sustained investigation of questions of economic policy and distributive justice. Two of the essays in that book were later combined and expanded upon to form what is no doubt Sumner's most famous single essay – "The Forgotten Man" (1884).
We may philosophize as coolly and correctly as we choose about our duties and about the laws of right living; no one of us lives up to what he knows. The man struck by the falling tree has, perhaps, been careless. We are all careless. Environed as we are by risks and perils, which befall us as misfortunes, no man of us is in a position to say, "I know all the laws, and am sure to obey them all; therefore I shall never need aid and sympathy." At the very best, one of us fails in one way and another in another, if we do not fail altogether. Therefore the man under the tree is the one of us who for the moment is smitten. It may be you tomorrow, and I next day. It is the common frailty in the midst of a common peril which gives us a kind of solidarity of interest to rescue the one for whom the chances of life have turned out badly just now. Probably the victim is to blame. He almost always is so. A lecture to that effect in the crisis of his peril would be out of place, because it would not fit the need of the moment; but it would be very much in place at another time, when the need was to avert the repetition of such an accident to somebody else. Men, therefore, owe to men, in the chances and perils of this life, aid and sympathy, on account of the common participation in human frailty and folly.
(1) It is not properly appreciated how much Sumner wrote on economic history and the important role he played in teaching free-market economic theory to the students at Yale University. His official position was professor of political and social science in Yale College, but he was free to lecture on economic topics as well, which he thought was quite an appropriate thing to do as the narrow compartmentalization of knowledge into such fields as sociology, political theory, politics, and economic history was just beginning. He wrote a sizable amount on the history of currency and banking in the United States, where he showed himself to be a strong advocate of hard (i.e., gold backed) currency, as for example in A History of American Currency (1884) and the volume on the United States in A History of Banking in All the Leading Nations (1896). He seemed to be well aware that "inflation" of the money supply in the form of expanded paper credit and money had a connection with bank failures and the business cycle, which plagued America throughout the 19th century, making him an "Austrian" theorist in the modern sense. He also taught introductory courses on economic theory to his students at Yale which showed wide reading in European economic thought (mainly French but also Friedrich von Wieser in a French translation, one of the pioneers of the marginalist school which emerged in the 1870s), as his class reading lists clearly show. He also listed in his course readings works by American followers of Frédéric Bastiat, such as as Amasa Walker. All of this work unfortunately has been forgotten or conveniently ignored for decades since advocates of laissez-faire economic policies are also anathema, along with "social Darwinists," often for similar reasons.
(2) Sumner was also doubly damned even in his own time for being a strong advocate of free trade in an America, which from its founding, had been strongly protectionist, even Listian in its trade policies. In the 1870s and 1880s free-trade groups had emerged in Chicago and New York which republished and adapted for an American audience works by the French free-trader Bastiat and works by the English-based Cobden Club, which championed Cobden-inspired free-trade literature at a time when tariff wars began to erupt again in Europe in the decades leading up to World War I. Sumner wrote free-trade material very much in the style of the great Bastiat, such as his criticism of protectionist "fallacies," or "sophisms," in his book Protectionism (1888). Sumner's free-trade activities extended beyond the lecture halls of Yale as his talks and attendance at free-trade meetings clearly show. For example, at the annual dinner held by the New York Free Trade Club held at Delmonico's restaurant in 1885, Sumner gave one of the toasts where he declared, "Free Trade: The only true 'American System'" in direct opposition to over 100 years of American economic policy which had followed the protectionists and statist "American System" of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay, and codified by Friedrich List in 1841.
Arguments such as this are familiar within the classical-liberal tradition. The most obvious parallel, of course, is to be found in the work of Friedrich Hayek, whose writings on complexity and spontaneous order develop the line of reasoning in perhaps its most sophisticated form. But arguments of this form were also common in the writings of Herbert Spencer, who often employed them to warn would-be reformers of the likely unintended consequences of their well-meaning meddling. For Spencer, each social phenomenon "is a link in an infinite series -- is the result of myriads of preceding phenomena, and will have a share in producing myriads of succeeding ones." Because phenomena are complexly interrelated, it is always the case that "in disturbing any natural chain of sequences, [legislators] are not only modifying the result next in succession, but all the future results into which this will enter as a part-cause." Social legislation is like trying to straighten out a wrought-iron plate with a hammer – attempts to flatten it here will only cause it to bend somewhere else. "What, then, shall we say about a society? 'Do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?' asks Hamlet. Is humanity more readily straightened than an iron plate?"
After graduating from Yale in 1863, Sumner studied languages, theology, and biblical history at the Universities of Geneva, Göttingen, and Oxford. He then returned to Yale in September 1867 to teach Greek before taking a position as Rector of the Church of the Redeemer in Morristown, NJ. where he worked from September 1870 to September 1872. He returned to Yale again but this time to teach in an entirely different field, that of “Political and Social Sciences” of which he was a professor for the next 37 years (between 1872 and his retirement in 1909). What is interesting is that he thought political economy played a very important role in what he called “political science in its widest sense” and that given “the degraded state of American politics and public life” into which the country had fallen since the Civil War, economic topics “now more especially demands our attention.” And this is what would occupy much of his time for the next 20 years. He summarized what would be almost his life’s work in countering the “moral and social deterioration” of the nation which was caused by the “economical mistakes” of protective tariffs and paper money, mistakes which were only made worse by policies adopted during the Civil War. Sumner believed it was the task of the economist, in whose ranks he believed he stood, to point out these mistakes and the enormous economic waste they caused for ordinary people:
I affirm that the questions on which our national future to-day depends are questions of political economy, questions of labor and capital, of finance and taxation. The fruits of the Civil War did not cease when the armies disbanded. It left us with financial and industrial legacies whose fruits, as every student of political economy and social science knows, are slow in ripening; and they contain seeds of future and still more disastrous crops. No man can estimate these long following results. No man can tell what social, moral, and political transformations they may produce. There is no field of activity which now calls so urgently for the activity of honest and conscientious men as the enlightenment of the American public on the nature and inevitable results of the financial and industrial errors to which they are committed. … The patriotism with which the American people submitted to the burdens of taxation and paper money, believing them to be necessary parts of the evil of the War, is deserving of the most enthusiastic admiration. It serves only to deepen the sadness with which the economist must declare the conviction that the paper money never was a necessity, never could in the nature of things be a necessity any more than it could be necessary for a physician to poison a patient in order to cure him of fever or for a man to become bankrupt to escape insolvency; and also this other conviction, not a matter of science but of history, that the necessity for taxation has been abused by the creation of a protective tariff which increases the burden which it pretends to carry. These two subjects, money and tariff, will be the subjects of my lectures during the present term.
The National Basketball Association is currently on its off-season but several of the league’s stars, including LeBron James, have strongly expressed support for the protests.A lot of the features I had dialled in on my last phone are automatic now. The dictionary is most noticeable. Since I can't program the words anymore, autocorrect has become a nightmare. Often, the phone persistently changes words that are jargon, and is really difficult to get used to. The keyboard also changed, which makes no sense. It's a classic case of IT engineers lacking basic understanding of the human counterpart. I thought buying another galaxy would get me a new improved version. I was wrong. It's a new, completely different phone. Pros: Faster processing, improved reception, better functionality overall from a hardware perspective. This is coming from the S5, so I'm not really surprised. I liked that phone a lot though. Of all of the galaxies I've had, that one was the best. It just got old, and compatibility was becoming an issue. I also like Bixby. I haven't used it much yet, but it's pretty cool. I hope Samsung gets it running properly, instead of abandoning it like most new ideas. Cons; I can't get a lot of the functions to work the way I like. It's like Samsung feels that they know what's best, and I should learn to trust their wisdom. It's annoying. My phone is supposed to be convenient for ME. I expect to use it MY way. My old phone allowed me to make it work the way i like. This one doesn't. Maybe I just haven't found the adjustments yet, but you'd think they'd be similar. The lock screen is really annoying. I have to go through three screens to get in. There's cooler biometrics on it, but so what? Is it really more secure? Is it more convenient? I don't think so. It's nice having the clock on the screen when it's not in use if you want, but it IS a hassle. The home button is gone. Now, there's a haptic feedback pressure sensor with no other use. I suppose that makes it easier to waterproof, but there have always been cases that solve that problem. Now the phone wouldn't work properly with a watertight case. I guess that's just adjusting, but I feel better having an actual button. The phone seems like it was designed strictly for people who enjoy flaunting the newest technology, not people like me who want the absolute best functionality. If I was in charge of Samsung, I'd have a version intended for people like me. Only tested, reliable functions. Let someone else field test the latest ideas. I want my tech to work the first time, every time. Other people like the newest prototypes. This phone is good for them. Summary: If you want the newest features, and don't really depend on your phone, this is a really hip phone to get. If you can't do without your phone working perfectly, you would probably be frustrated by this one. It's fine, overall, but by not being able to adjust functions to fine tune them, this phone forces you to give too much attention to tasks you just want to finish, and get on with your day. Honestly, this phone is making me nostalgic for the days when we all used landlines.

That Apple has probably taken note of this (even in private) is an understatement—the voice-activated Siri is at the center of the current iPhone 4S marketing campaign. This "exclusive" feature appears to be anything but. [AppleInsider]By By Ralph Lopez Feb 21, 2013 in World The Newtown, Connecticut Town Clerk is seeking to deny newspapers from viewing public record death certificates of Sandy Hook victims, according to the Newtown Bee. The New York Post, the Connecticut Post, the Associated Press, the Hartford Courant, and other media have put forth requests for official death certificates of Sandy Hook victims, "that would provide the press and public with limited directory information from death and marriage records, but would withhold the actual death and marriage certificates." Death certificates are part of vital public records, which also include birth and marriage certificates. They are public domain documents used, ultimately, to determine official recognition of presence or past presence in civil society. They also serve as a mechanism for upholding the integrity of information in which there is a public interest, as it relates to voting, citizenship, and receiving public benefits. Abuses of voting processes involving voters who, unbeknownst to the public, are actually dead, are legendary. Death certificates typically contain little information about manner of death beyond categories such as "natural cause," "homicide," "accident," "suicide," or "other." News organizations utilize such records in crime reporting as a standard part of normal, often tedious, fact-checking procedures. Death certificates also contain the sworn statement of the medical examiner. The Newtown Bee stated: "Ms Aurelia said she has received requests for death certificates and other proprietary information from the New York Post , the Connecticut Post , the Associated Press and the Hartford Courant among others." "Some are also requesting all my e-mail correspondence and text messages related to 12/14," she said." According to the Newtown Bee, Assistant Town Clerk Renee Weimann said "I feel it’s my responsibility to protect these victims. They’ve been through enough.” Last December 14th, 20 children and 8 adults died in a shooting rampage by alleged shooter Adam Lanza. Ms Aurelia and members of her staff testified in favor of such a bill at a hearing of the state's Public Health Committee last February 20th. The law would also exclude members of the public who are not "immediate family/authorized agency/attorney" from viewing the records, according to the Newtown Bee. The Bee reported that the media and other sources have been making the requests under existing Freedom of Information Act laws. Media can take local, state, and federal government agencies to court over failure to comply with requests for information. The move comes as the public awaits the answers to questions such as whether or not alleged shooter Adam Lanza "identify persons cooperating with the investigation, thus possibly jeopardizing their personal safety and well-being." Yesterday the Hartford Courant ran a report in which Jim Smith, president of the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information, said a death certificate is a factual document that lacks the details of an autopsy report. The “There isn’t anything in a death certificate that is going to hurt the deceased...it’s not like an autopsy report. It’s been public for centuries. It’s not going to invade anyone’s privacy.’’ CT State Representatives Bolinsky and Carter, and Newtown Town Clerk Aurelia, all argued, The Clerk maintains that access to vital records such as death and marriage certificates should be limited to immediate family members or their representatives, and has undertaken to change present law.The New York Post, the Connecticut Post, the Associated Press, the Hartford Courant, and other media have put forth requests for official death certificates of Sandy Hook victims, the Newton Bee report says .

Also lacking is any further elaboration on a Connecticut State's Attorney's statement last December, in a court motion, that there may be other "potential suspects," and that revealing certain evidence at this time might "seriously jeopardize" the investigation. Connecticut State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky also said that revealing certain evidence at this time might:Yesterday the Hartford Courant ran a report in which Jim Smith, president of the Connecticut Council on Freedom of Information, said a death certificate is a factual document that lacks the details of an autopsy report. The Courant quotes Smith saying:CT State Representatives Bolinsky and Carter, and Newtown Town Clerk Aurelia, all argued, according to the Courant , that identify theft was a concern, since the maiden name of the deceased's mother is on death certificates. However, this is also on birth certificates, which are not a target of the trio. Also, the proposed legislation would seal the death records only of minors under 18. It is unclear why identity thieves would not merely steal the identities of people over that age.

The Telugu film industry is the most prolific film industry in the world itself. If India produces the world���s most number of films, it is Telugu films in the country which top the list.Statistics available show that between April 2013 and March 2014, a total of 1966 films were made in India. Out of this, 349 were Telugu films, topping the list of films produced.Considering that the long drought of the coveted best national film award had eluded the Telugu film industry, the producer of ���Baahubali��� was naturally elated after the award was announced.���Winning the 63rd National Award for the best film is a huge achievement. Being the first Telugu Film to do so makes it all the more special!��� producer of ���Baahubali��� Shobhu Yarlagadda said. Prasad Devineni and K Raghavendra Rao are the other producers of the film.The epic movie set in the mythical ���Mahismathi��� kingdom in India wowed audiences across India and abroad too. Made with an estimated budget of Rs 120 crore, it is said the film garnered revenue up to Rs 600 cr.The film fascinated audiences because of its visual effects. The fact that producer Shobhu Yarlagadda acknowledged Srinivas Mohan who oversaw the visual effects speaks for the visual delight the movie was. The award means recognition for the producers.The best director award, however, has eluded S S Rajamouli who has literally worked magic at the box-office with the film.Till late in the afternoon, Rajamouli did not react about the national award on his twitter account. His last tweet was on March 25 appreciating the released recently film 'Oopiri' starring Nagarjuna and directed by Vamsi. The lead actor of the film Prabhas retweeted all the congratulatory messages which poured in, including from Anuskha Shetty, who also featured in the film. Another actor Rana Dabbubati who also featured in the movie was excited about the film getting the award.Actress Tamannaah Bhatia was also all excited about 'Baahubali' winning the award. ���Congratulations to our lovely team,��� she tweeted. ���This is awesome, awesome, awesome,��� said well-known director Krish Jagarlamudi about 'Baahubali' winning the best national film award. Actresses Samantha Ruth Prabhu also congratulated the team.Actor NTR Jr also congratulated the team. ���Congratulations to team Baahubali and Rajamouli scoring the prestigious national award for the best film. A big win for Telugu cinema,��� he said.The announcement of the national film awards brought cheer to Krish Jagarlamudi also as the film that he directed ���Kanche��� won the best film in Telugu category. The film produced by Y Rajeev Reddy and J Sai Babu featured Varun Tej and Pragya Jaiswal.'Kanche' came as a refreshing change on the Telugu screen as it was set in the 1930s. The film woven around World War-11 and has love as the primary theme. The protagonist joins the British Indian Army and comes out as strong drama. Part of the film was shot in Georgia.Kanche was made with a budget of Rs 21 crore reportedly made double its investment. For three years from 2009-11, there was no award given for best film in Telugu but from the years 2012 till date, a Telugu film was able to get a best Telugu film award. If the jury considers that none of the films submitted are good enough, they do not give a best film award in the regional language films category.Fifty-four years after he accidentally wandered across the eastern frontier into India following the 1962 war with China, a Chinese soldier has returned home to Xi’an to a hero’s welcome.
This is India's dirty war: a brutal struggle over valuable real estate that pits the Naxalites against some of the nation's most powerful commercial interests. What began 43 years ago as a small but violent peasant insurrection in Naxalbari, a West Bengal village, is now a full-fledged conflict led by the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) across 20 of the country's 28 states (see map below), affecting 223 districts. The fight is over land, much of it in the interior, that has rich deposits of coal and bauxite. On one side of the struggle are the rebels--perhaps 10,000 of them armed and out in the field every day, and a militia of 100,000 who can be called up on short notice. Driven by a violent ideology, the Naxalites claim to be fighting for the land rights of the poor, especially farmers and small indigenous tribes who know only an agrarian way of life. On the other side are the wealthy families behind Tata Steel, Jindal Steel & Power and Vedanta Resources (run by mining mogul Anil Agarwal), who want to develop the untapped resources. (The three companies rank 345, 1,131 and 923 on the Global 2000 list.) Caught in the middle of the conflict between Maoists and billionaires are thousands of villagers. (See: "My Family's Narrow Escape From India's Dirty War")
It's no mystery why things have gotten worse. "India's boom period has coincided with maximum dissent and dissatisfaction in rural India," says Ajai Sahni, executive director for the Institute for Conflict Management, a New Delhi think tank. Over the last decade the Indian government has been trying by legal and other means to lock up the land for public projects like power plants and, more recently, for private enterprises like Tata. (Under the Indian constitution nontribal people are prohibited from directly acquiring land in certain parts of the country, so the government must obtain it on their behalf and sell it to the companies.) That trend has put the state more and more in conflict with the Maoist rebels, and it has ratcheted up paramilitary operations against them. The government has also squared off more frequently against those who have farmed the land for centuries, using various legal entitlements--and, villagers often claim, resorting to fraud or force--to gain possession of the property. Other times the state simply seizes the land, labeling any resistance rebel-inspired. Hundreds of thousands of people have been dispossessed and displaced. Many now live in what could become permanent refugee camps, where they are prey to both sides of the proxy war and easy converts to radicalism.
chopped almonds for topping, optional Instructions Place the chopped dates in a small mixing bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups of hot water. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. Drain the dates and discard the water. Place the dates in a high speed blender with 1 can of full fat coconut milk (about 1 3/4 cups). Puree on high until smooth. Add the remaining can of full fat coconut milk, unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, NuNatural’s Liquid Vanilla Stevia, and sea salt. Blend until smooth. Pour into a mason jar with a lid and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours or until very cold. Give the chilled custard a quick stir (it may separate in the refrigerator as it chills, this is completely normal) and then pour into an ice cream maker (I recommend this one) and churn according to manufacturer's instructions. Place half of the ice cream into a freezer safe 1 1/2-2 quart glass storage container (I use the biggest container in this set) and then gently spread 1/4-1/3 cups of the fudge sauce over the top of the ice cream. Repeat the layers with the remaining ice cream and fudge sauce. Serve immediately for soft serve, or freeze for at least 4-6 hours for a firmer texture. Top with chopped almonds if desired. Recipe Notes from Megan The brand of canned coconut milk you use can make a HUGE difference in the quality and taste of your ice cream. My absolute favorite brand of coconut milk is the Aroy-D brand , which is guar gum and preservative free. I don’t recommend using the Natural Value brand, as often times it’s gritty and will not produce ice cream with a smooth texture. 3.5.3226
State police say 75 people were arrested for underage drinking, driving while intoxicated and illegal drug use and at least 50 had to be treated for alcohol poisoning during a concert at the Nikon at Jones Beach Amphitheater Tuesday evening.Police said the fans were tailgating for "The High Road" tour with Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa, and many of those who required treatment for drugs or alcohol were inside the venue.At least 50 people were aided by EMS, and ambulances transported 10 to area hospitals. Many were picked up by parents, but several still recovering at area facilities on Wednesday.One 18-year-old was in listed serious condition after falling on his head while he was intoxicated, and a total of three patients remain in the ICU as Nassau University Medical Center.State police were also on the scene, confiscating alcohol and dumping it out.A spokesperson issued the following statement:"Law enforcement has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking in New York State and our state parks. Through a joint partnership with the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Nassau County Taxi and Limousine Commission, 75 arrests were made at the August 9 concert at the Nikon Theater at Jones Beach. People who jeopardize public safety with underage drinking, driving while intoxicated and illegal drug use or possession will not be tolerated."The State Parks PBA tells Eyewitness News that only 16 officers were assigned to the concert, and the head of the union said they were overwhelmed."It is unfathomable that 16 police officers are tasked with controlling a crowd of 10,000 or more," Sergeant Manny Vilar said in a statement. "Naturally, no one should be surprised at the occurrence, and we are fortunate that no one died."On Friday night, 42 people were hurt when a railing collapsed at a tour stop in Camden.Florida A&M got off on the wrong foot in its game against Arkansas Thursday.
It was an unusual casting situation because I got the job the day before we had to start filming, like less than 24 hours before. It was given to someone else, a different actor, and they had a scheduling conflict. So it was like 2:00 p.m. on a Wednesday, and Mark (whom I’d worked with before — like five or six years ago — we’d always stayed friends; he’d never asked me to work on any of his projects) texted me, “Do you want to be on my HBO show Thursday or Friday?” I right away was like, “Yeah.” He was like, “Let me send you the script.” To myself, I was like, I’m gonna do it [before getting the script]. [Once I saw it], I was like, This is a very unique and difficult job. It was like a one-person show, and we shot that in two days, which is very fast. Most shows take five days. We did like 15 pages a day. I was like, This is crazy. Mark said this was not written for an Indian person specifically. It was written more generically. And so, Mark — what he likes to do is for you to be free and improvise, not a lot, but there’s a bunch of stuff where there’s little moments where I can make it seem more believable that we’re actually related. When we have banter.
She was brought in that morning, or a few hours before. There was a lot of drama going into it. At the time, I was on a show on Starz, and I was a series regular. Under that contract, I wasn’t allowed to do HBO. I didn’t get cleared until 7:00 p.m. that night. So, they didn’t find someone to play my mom. I met Poorna for five seconds and we started shooting. I had no relationship with her. I think it was good. I had to imagine that it was my mom, and my mom luckily is very bad at technology, so that was a very easy kind of thing, a testament to the quality of the writing. And then the director did a lot of stuff on the other end — I basically had an earpiece and I could hear Poorna’s performance live. She was in a different room. He gave her a lot of stuff there — at one point when she was chopping vegetables, I heard the sound of that. That’s something my mom does all the time. She’ll ask for a phone call so I’ll carve out the time, and she’ll start cooking or something, and I can hear her and she’s not paying attention. I find it really frustrating. Apparently Doug hid the actual laptop in the room, and [Poorna] actually couldn’t find it. So I’m on the phone during this pause. There was stuff like that. I was unaware, and Poorna obviously couldn’t see what I was doing at all.
I feel like I’ve been very fortunate. When I went to theater school, most of the people I graduated with aren’t working. I’ve consistently worked and made a good living. I do feel a lot of times you’re not given the opportunity to fully show your potential. I just haven’t had a chance to show it. For me, this was a chance to really — you can’t hide. You’re on-camera the whole time. You have to juggle all the genres, have to be real with it and show a raw side of yourself, or it’s not going to work. I’ve never been given that opportunity. I just feel very lucky that early on in my career I got to do something like this. That’s a testament to Mark and Jay. That’s kind of their brand, as far as I see it. They can see the potential in other people that people don’t realize in themselves. With Mark, I was freaking out about not having enough time, but he was the most calming. He was so confident. In a weird way, if someone is so confident in you, it makes you be like, Oh, I guess they’ve seen something in me I haven’t seen. They’ve hired so many writers and directors who haven’t done anything, which never happens. When you hand it to someone like that, it’s very sink or swim. But they know who’s going to sink or swim.
When he told me he thought I could do it, I very honestly was like, He is making a mistake. I was like, What has he seen that makes him think I could do it? On the page it didn’t read so much that the character was getting annoyed. I was like, I don’t think Mark has seen me talk like that. What he said to me was, “I just want this to be a very sweet episode. I need you to bring this sweetness to it at the end where you really feel for this guy, where you don’t want him to fail.” This poor kid, he can’t catch a break. When I got on this, I was really like, I’m just going to draw on my experience, and that was that I get really mad at my mom when I talk to her about stuff like this. I don’t think he’s ever seen me snappy or anything. When I’ve been around him, I’m always at my best behavior. When I watch the episode, I feel ugly. That is unfortunately how I talk to my mom if we’re alone and she’s saying something annoying — I will be really mean.
Galiteva was a speaker at last month's Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) "The Future of Energy" Summit in New York, where the state is undertaking one of the nation's most ambitious regulatory overhauls. New York's Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) plan aims to transform the state's electricity use by mandating utilities to focus on demand response, smart grid, distributed generation, and storage. "We needed better markets and price signals for distributed assets and renewable energy," says Audrey Zibelman, chair of the New York Public Service Commission and a key architect of REV. "Our message to utilities is, 'Your job is no longer just delivering to the meter.' We want to make utilities the drivers of change, instead of the deer in the headlights." In the biggest pilot case to date, ConEdison has embarked on a $250 million effort to develop 52 MW of demand-side resources to replace the need for a new substation and transmission lines in Brooklyn with a $1 billion price tag. On the supply side, New York has one of the nation's most aggressive RPS goals of 29 percent renewables by the end of this year (required to be procured by NYSERDA, rather than generated by in-state utilities like most states' programs).
Jesse talks about Richard Linklater’s Everybody Wants Some as a reflection of the necessity for people to fall into spells of nostalgia, even if just for 90 minutes.US whistleblower Edward Snowden. Julian Assange claimed to be assisting him from the Ecuador embassy in London Credit:Reuters/NBC News Assange said police gather intelligence on visitors and that the British government has spent almost $10 million on 24-hour surveillance of the embassy lest he ever dare to leave the small building, close to Harrods in Knightsbridge. If he does leave, he faces immediate extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over alleged sexual misconduct involving two women – for which he is yet to be charged after four years. He dismisses it as a trumped-up, politically driven distraction from the main game: the United States, where Vice-President Joe Biden has called him a “high-tech terrorist”. Michael Ratner, Assange’s US legal representative, told the news conference that his client, if extradited to the US, could face similar treatment to Chelsea Manning, the US soldier formerly called Bradley serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks. Assange could be punished with solitary confinement and held in underground cells, Ratner said. But Assange said the second anniversary of his asylum at the embassy would be marked by a release of documents by WikiLeaks “in the field of international negotiations” – and extending to 50 countries. He would not elaborate. The message was to stay tuned.
Julian Assange said former foreign affairs minister Bob Carr lied about the level of consular assistance offered to the WikiLeaks founder. Credit:Peter Rae In another plug he said: “You will see that WikiLeaks has turned into a security document search service, now with more than eight million documents instantly searchable if you go to search.wikileaks.org.” Assange remains hands-on while confined. “The situation does create certain difficulties. On the other hand, unlike other national security reporters, I am in an effective jurisdiction where I cannot be subpoenaed; there cannot be any police knocks in the night or in the day... “If you look at the situation of getting Edward Snowden out of Hong Kong and trying to manage that from an embassy under extensive surveillance in the largest intelligence manhunt the world has ever seen, you can understand that securing communications between here and Hong Kong in such circumstances is on the very edge of what state-of-the-art is. And we are proud that our techniques were successful in that instance and we are developing systems to allow others to use them more broadly.” Assange said he kept close contact with the legal team for Snowden, who has been granted asylum in Russia. But he refused to say whether he is in direct contact with Snowden due to the “security situation”.
Assange claimed he was punished for helping Snowden. British Foreign Secretary William Hague had agreed to a working group on Assange’s case after meeting Ecuador’s foreign minister last year, but: “Following our involvement in gaining Edward Snowden asylum … my involvement … the United Kingdom unilaterally cancelled that working group.” A British Foreign Office spokesman was quoted saying: “We have neither cancelled nor suspended our working group with the Ecuadorian authorities, but remain as committed as ever to reaching a diplomatic solution to this situation. As ever, we look to Ecuador to help bring Mr Assange's difficult, and costly, residence to an end.” Next week Assange’s lawyers will lodge a challenge in Sweden against the extradition case. Australian lawyer Jennifer Robinson, on the conference call, said the case was based on “new information gathered in Sweden” but she declined to give details. Assange’s lawyers say they have invited the Swedish prosecutor four times to come and question him at the embassy, but the offer has been refused. Even if that extradition-without-charge warrant was dismissed, “I still have the larger problem”. The US, he said, could send extradition warrants “sealed” and “secret” to Britain, or it could send a preliminary extradition request without paperwork – and worry about those details 40 days later. The British police had “instructions to arrest me even if I was in a diplomatic car, even if I had diplomatic immunity”, and the police units involved included the counterterrorism command and the covert squad. They were treating him as a security threat, not as the subject of a normal extradition request.
Assange called on US Attorney-General Eric Holder to halt a federal grand jury investigation of him and WikiLeaks. “It is against the stated principles of the United States and I believe the values supported by its people, to have a four-year criminal investigation against a publisher,” Assange said. “The ongoing existence of that investigation produces a chilling effect, not just on internet based publishers, but all publishers.” Assange advised Barack Obama to reflect on his legacy or be remembered as the US president who conducted “more espionage investigations against journalists than all presidents going back to 1917 and the original issuance of the Espionage Act”. On the former Australian Labor foreign minister, Assange said: “Bob Carr has admitted in his biography that he lied to the Australian public in saying that I had had more consular assistance in equivalent time than any other Australian. He admits to lying and says that he did it – he lied – to quote, ‘needle me’.” For the computer-illiterate, Assange helpfully added: “And you can find reference to that if you search the internet for ‘Bob Carr’, ‘Assange’ and ‘needle’.” Or you could read Mr Carr’s book, in which he indeed said he wanted to needle Assange’s “self-righteousness”.
Canadians with long memories might reflect on the irony that in another era, under a prime minister of the same last name, the interdependence of the two economies tended to be portrayed as an existential problem. Now it is an ideal to preserve and protect with all the means at the disposal of a federal government. By a twist of electoral fate, Trudeau has become the keeper of Brian Mulroney’s free-trade legacy. But at what cost down the road? Since Trump’s inauguration, the prime minister had strived to not let obviously deep differences on immigration and refugee policy poison the Canada-U.S. trade well. That was always going to be easier to accomplish at a distance than in the physical proximity of a joint news conference. Confronted with the contradictions in their approaches Monday, the two leaders observed a tacit pact of non-aggression. Trudeau stuck to his guns on the notion that Syrian refugees are not by definition a security risk without sticking those guns overtly in the face of the president. Even as Trump promoted his travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, he took a pass at an opportunity to link the measure to the security of the Canada-U.S. border.
A bill currently making its way through Parliament would give U.S. border agents new powers to question, search and even detain Canadian citizens on Canadian soil. Existing arrangements already allow American border officials operating inside Canada’s major airports under a long-standing pre-clearance agreement between the two countries to implement whatever version of Trump’s travel ban finds favour with the U.S. justice system. Then there is Canada’s designation of the U.S. as a safe country for refugee purposes, a measure that prevents most people who land in the United States from applying for refugee status in this country. No one envisaged a Trump-style travel ban at the time those measures were put in place. But if the president does stick with plans to selectively ban immigrants, refugees and visitors to the U.S. on the basis of their country of origin, it will be hard for Trudeau to continue to look the other way and at the same time pretend that Canada is leading by example by sticking to its principles. In any event, for now, many in this country — particularly in corporate Canada — will take comfort in the notion that Canada is not on the Trump administration’s hit list. For his first face-to-face meeting with his new American counterpart, Trudeau had brought along a gaggle of senior cabinet ministers and advisers. Rarely has Canada had as much face time on a single day with as many members of a rookie American administration. It would not have happened if Trump had not wanted to play along. It might be best to savour the fragrance of the rose while it lasts!
By Alan Keyes Not long ago, in the context of a furor over the Confederate flag, I wrote two articles, comprising an essay about the deceitful nature of the demand that Americans cleanse our public consciousness of anything that honors Americans who practiced and/or advocated racism, the enslavement of blacks, or the law-enforced regime of racial segregation, discrimination, and bigotry our nation once tolerated. In the first part of the essay , I anticipated the crisis that is now being exploited to tar President Trump with opprobrium for his alleged reluctance to set racist violence apart for special condemnation. In the second part , I asked people to ponder the subversive anti- American agenda this demand for anti-racist purity actually serves:It surprises me that people who profess to be followers of Christ seem willing to accept the unforgiving demand for historical cleansing that puts human beings in the place of God when it comes to judging sinners after death.Gen. Sherman said that "War is hell." There are many who would say that – during his infamous "scorched earth" campaign through Georgia during the late fall of 1864 – he did his best to act the part of Satan's lieutenant, as his forces torched and tormented both infrastructure and people along the way. In his Second Inaugural, Lincoln literally accepts the premise that the Civil War was punishment God inflicted on the people of the United State for the sin of practicing, or by law protecting, racist slavery.Why is it not enough for the present generation of self-righteous sinners in the United States that God exacted this terrible price for our nation's sins? Why is it not enough that, on account of the scourge of war, Americans repented of the sin our nation knowingly inflicted on my enslaved ancestors? They let my people go, even as Pharaoh let go the Israelites, on account of the plagues God visited upon his kingdom. The nation repented of its sin.Despite the strong resentment of many of his fellow southerners, Robert E. Lee did not refuse to surrender, at Appomattox, to God's will. He did not refuse to urge his fellow Confederates to accept God's judgment against the sin of slavery, and get on with building the nation that had finally reconciled itself to the law of liberty God prescribed for His Creation. To be sure, he did not instantly purge himself of the views and preferences America's long-established culture of racial bigotry inevitably inculcated. There were doubtless many times when those habits betrayed him into unjust attitudes, remarks, and actions.But for all that, like many of his compatriots in the States of the Confederacy, he appears to have resisted the temptation to foreswear the terms of its surrender. How many times should we forgive them for sliding back into the furrows of racist bigotry and pride? How often should we forgive them the credit they are due, for deciding, nonetheless, to uphold the discipline of God's justice required by the premises of our national existence?Shall we tear down the statues of President Lyndon Johnson for the evidence of racist bigotry in his political life? Or should we honor the leadership he gave to complete the passage of the Civil Rights Act? Should we forbid the people of Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia to honor the memories of the ancestors who labored, for all their faults, to build a future of decent liberty for their posterity? Or should we leave them to honor people like Thomas Jefferson, James F. Byrnes (Truman's secretary of state), and Jimmy Carter for the service they gave to establish the right foundations of our nation, preserve it in service to human decency from totalitarian tyranny, or upraise throughout the world its standard for human rights and dignity?By the standard of true moral perfection, all humanity falls short. Some of the same people who spit on Lee's statue angrily rejected the notion that Margaret Sanger's statue should be removed from an exhibit at the Smithsonian. When the standard of perfect right and justice is applied, which of us will escape the judgment our unpaid debt to truth and righteousness deserves? We shall all require forgiveness no human being is equipped to give us. Why then is it right that any of us should demand leave to inflict implacable judgment on others, even though they have largely repented of their sins?As a Christian, praying each day the publican's prayer, I have struggled to heed Christ's warnings. I reject those who think that it is loving to let people risk the ultimate judgment of God. So, I refuse to lie about what He says is required to avoid perdition. But I also reject the hubris that purports to punish people, after death, with annihilation. That power belongs to God and God alone. He will remember those He will remember, according to the perfect standard onlytruly understands.Let history be. Leave those who will not be converted by the Gospel of truth to the judgment of God. But if they repent, surrendering, however imperfectly, to the standard of God's truth and justice, forgive them unceasingly, as we must unceasingly pray that God will forgive us. Such forgiveness is the only way to endure in the fight against evil, without becoming evil – the only way to learn and remember what we need to know of evil in order to defeat it – and to do it all without forgetting what is good and right and true and just. Which is to say, without forgetting that, and we are© Alan KeyesBRADENTON, Fla. — Because players move around so much via trades and free agency, it is not unusual to see a rainbow of different teams’ equipment bags around the clubhouse at the start of spring training.

Or that the father of all humans ("Adam") was alive 40-50,000 years ago? These estimates come from looking at differences in the Y chromosome over time. But wait a minute you might be saying. You just said that we can use the Y chromosome for historical studies because it can't recombine and so stays constant. Notice I said earlier that the Y chromosome passes from generation to generation virtually unchanged. It does change a little over time because of random mutations (nothing is perfect including copying DNA). It is these rare mutations that let scientists date when things have happened in the past. Scientists use DNA to estimate when things have happened in the past by assuming a certain rate of mutations over time. Let's say that the Y chromosome gets 1 new mutation/generation (much higher than the actual rate). If this is the case, then if two people have 10 differences between them, then they are 10 generations apart. The mutation rate scientists have used in the past was based on circumstantial evidence because there was just too much DNA to sequence. Until now. For the first time, groups in Indiana and New Hampshire have figured out a mutation rate based on sequencing huge amounts of DNA from lots of the roundworm, C. elegans. How much DNA? An astonishing 4 million base pairs -- an impossible number just a few years ago. What the researchers found was that the mutation rate was 10 times higher than previously believed or around 2 mutations/generation for C. elegans. There are possible reasons that given the way the experiment was done, the mutation rate might have been artificially high. But, if the new number is true, it calls into question all sorts of things. For example, partly based on DNA evidence, scientists believed that chimps and humans separated about 5 million years ago. Was it actually 500,000 years ago? Humans began their migration out of Africa 100,000 years ago. Or was it 10,000? Did "Adam" live 50,000 or 5000 years ago? Some of these new numbers are obviously wrong. From archeological digs, we know there were people in Europe, Asia, and even the Americas more than 10,000 years ago. From fossil evidence we know that chimps and humans separated more than 500,000 years ago. Obviously, then, more work needs to be done to get at this critical number. And if the mutation rate isn't constant over time, we may never be able to get a good number. In the meantime, the work done here will need to be repeated lots more times before we begin rewriting history. With the advent of new sequencing technologies, we are now able to do experiments undreamed of just a few years ago.NBN, British Telecom and turning back the clock
LLL Integration: Once the Library including Static and Dynamic Databases is finished, next will be integrating LLP, LLD, and LLS with possible LLE for encrypted communications and high efficiencies in protocol responses and data storage. Every channel reinforces the others to prevent 51% attacks on one channel, forcing attacker across multiple channels.Nexus uses a combination of different hashes, including Keccak-1600, Skein-1024, SK-576, SK-512, and SK-256.Using Skein-1024 and Keccak-1600 for GPU PoW to produce a 1024 bit output hash used for the block hash providing the highest security.Searching for Dense Prime Clusters as CPU PoW, finding these clusters of numbers that are ~308 digits to verify prime density in large numbers.571 Bit Private Keys compared to 256 bit in other currencies. Using NID_sect571r1 as the algorithm.Calculated with time overlaps and true % over bounds, using weighted block average over past 5 blocks.Lower Level Protocol as a template protocol to allow any protocol to be created with ease without need for repeated network programming.Protocol responsible for time keeping as an advancement to NTP, keeping clocks on the network synchronized within a few seconds of one another. Maximum clock drift for Nexus is 10 seconds.Dedicated Mining Protocol outside of JSON-RPC Server to allow the greatest performance for mining. Protocol can handle 5k + connections allowing solo mining of any magnitude.Rewards are calculated along an exponential decay curve to slowly reduce the value of each block rather than shock both miners and the market with block reward halving which acts as a rudimentary decay model.Decayed amounts are deposited into the Reserves for each channel, preventing a miner from being able to mint more than the projected amount while difficulty is compensating to their amount of computing power.When reserves are below given thresholds, the mining reward is then based off of the time it took to create a block preventing a miner from ever being able to deplete the reserves.Every 60 minutes, the Nexus protocol automatically creates a checkpoint. This prevents blocks from being created or modified dated prior to this checkpoint, thus protecting the chain from malicious attempts to introduce an alternate blockchain.The minting rate increases the longer a node secures the blockchain, incentivizing nodes to actively stake. This increases the difficulty for successfully attacking the network, as nodes with greater Trust are more likely to find new blocks.Nexuss Proof of Holding system is based upon the Peercoin protocol, completely recoded and redesigned from scratch, utilizing an efficiency threshold, trust keys, and logarithmic weights to create the fairest and most stable staking system to date.The Developer Fund fuels ongoing development and is sourced by a 1.5% commission per block mined, which will slowly increase to 2.5% after 10 years. This brings all the benefits of development funding without the associated risks and limits the control which can exerted by the developer account.The Ambassador (renamed from Exchange) keys are funded by a 20% commission per block reward. These keys are mainly used to pay for marketing, and producing and launching the Nexus satellites.
Nexus uses 3 consensus channels to maximize decentralization and provide fast, secure transactions. Each channel has an independent difficulty algorithm, amongst other checks and balances, to prevent a single channel from monopolizing block production and compromising the security of the network. Nexus channels include a Prime channel (CPU Mining), a Hashing channel (GPU Mining), and Nexus Proof of Holding (nPOH).Nexus takes the proof-of-stake system developed by Peercoin, and combines it with a Trust-based weighting system to create the Proof-of-Holding consensus mechanism. Nodes receive a Trust rating that is established by their contributions to the network, which increases over time. Nodes with greater Trust are granted an increased minting rate, which increases from 0.5% to 3% within one year, the longer you build Trust on the network.Nexus aims to be one of the most secure blockchains in the world by increasing decentralization, and implementing quantum resistance. Using multiple consensus channels greatly reduces the risk of a 51% attack, as an attacker would need to control all 3 channels. A set of checks and balances prevents an individual channel from being able to compromise the entire network.Nexus uses a combination of SHA3 hashing algorithms combined with 571 bit private keys and 512/1024 bit proof of work, to make Nexus one of the worlds leading quantum-resistant blockchains.Furthermore, Nexus is developing an evolving key signature scheme to keep an accounts public keys obscured even when making transactions. This is made possible by moving away from addresses based on public key hashes, and implementing a new system called Signature Chains.While other blockchains consider larger block sizes or off-chain payment channels in an effort to increase transaction throughput, the Nexus 3DC proposes another solution, allowing Nexus to scale completely on-chain.Transaction processing is distributed across multiple channels working synergistically to increase transaction throughput as resources increase. Individual channels verify transactions, consolidate verified transactions into Merkle trees, and add finished blocks onto the blockchain. The Unified Time protocol enables transaction processing, trust locks, and block locks to be consistent throughout time. The potential of Nexus 3DC is limited only by node count and represents the most energy-efficient consensus system to date.As decentralized as blockchain technology strives to be, it nevertheless remains dependant on traditional infrastructure. By combining the decentralized blockchain software, satellite and ground based mesh networks, and a large team of passionate people, Nexus is focused on gaining a high degree of autonomy from external influences. By placing our own communication infrastructure in space, the network wont be susceptible to government jurisdiction (similar to international waters).Nexus is actively building relationships within the aerospace industry to allow for the hardware infrastructure to be compatible with its transaction system.Truth in Packaging time…
In a second blow to the flood protection authority Friday, Jindal announced that Tim Doody, a St. Bernard Parish resident who has served on the authority since it was created, will be replaced by Tyrone Ben, a fellow St. Bernard resident who works for the Guidance Center, an outpatient behavioral health and counseling center. Doody is the fourth member of the authority who supported the suit to be replaced since the case was filed. With Doody’s replacement, only five of the nine members of the board are on record in favor of continuing the suit. Two more members, one who supports the suit and one who opposes it, are expected to be up for renomination later this year. Ben, who was urged to apply for a seat on the board by former St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro, currently an official in Jindal’s administration, said he did not have a “political agenda” in applying for the seat. Based on his experience working for oil and gas companies, Ben said, he is inclined to believe that because energy companies needed to receive permits for their work, they were already being regulated and the lawsuit was not necessary. However, he said he was willing to listen to those who disagree. “I don’t know anything on the other side of the argument,” Ben said. “I would be open-minded. I would be willing to listen. Evidently they had something that compelled them to file it in the first place.” Jindal officials have said opposition to the suit would be a “litmus test” for all new appointees to the authority, and Ben said he was asked about the case by Jindal administration officials prior to his appointment. “I said if my selection was predicated on that, I might not be the best person for the job,” he said. Because he was appointed after the session ended, Ben will not have to face Senate confirmation until next year’s session. Jindal’s other three appointees were all confirmed by the Senate this year.
AT&T, which needed Mr. Jindal, a Republican, to sign off on legislation allowing the company to sell cable television services without having to negotiate with individual parishes, has pledged at least $250,000 to the Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana’s Children. Marathon Oil, which last year won approval from the Jindal administration to increase the amount of oil it can refine at its Louisiana plant, also committed to a $250,000 donation. And the military contractor Northrop Grumman, which got state officials to help set up an airplane maintenance facility at a former Air Force base, promised $10,000 to the charity. The foundation has collected nearly $1 million in previously unreported pledges from major oil companies, insurers and other corporations in Louisiana with high-stakes regulatory issues, according to a review by The New York Times. …. Dow Chemical, which has pledged $100,000 to the foundation, is the largest petrochemical company in Louisiana and has had numerous interactions with state officials during the Jindal administration, including an investigation into a July 2009 spill at its St. Charles Parish plant that forced the evacuation of area homes. The state in December 2009 proposed fining the company and its Union Carbide subsidiary for allowing the release of a toxic pollutant and failing to quickly notify state authorities of the leak, but so far no fine has been assessed. …. Alon USA, an Israeli oil company that has pledged $250,000 to the Jindal Foundation, last year sought permit changes that would allow it to discharge more pollutants at its Krotz Springs refinery. In 2009, state environmental officials also eased requirements for the company to check for spills of oil, ammonia or other contaminants in waterways to twice a month, instead of twice a week, records show. Several of the charity’s major donors are large state contractors, like Acadian Ambulance, or D&J Construction, which alone has received $67.6 million in contracts since 2009, mostly for highways, said a separate report on the foundation being issued this week by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Both companies have pledged at least $10,000 to the foundation.
been tripping since 2005-2006, shortly after graduating from high school. Back then, dankity LSD was plentiful in Houston area. Had an acid wave lasting over a year or so. In that time i was doing acid almost every weekend. I loved it soo much, it quickly became my favorite drug. Before that, shrooms were my drugs of choice. Cant tell ya how many times ive tripped or how many hits of acid ive taken (as it still goes on today from time to time), but the number is in the hundreds or early thousands. I find psychedelics are easy to handle. You just gotta be calm and have a positive outlook. 'Bad trips' dont normally happen, rather you might be in a bad mood and not enjoying your trip. For me, LSD led to experimenting with DMT and Mescaline. LSD is my drug of choice, but you'll never experience anything like DMT. Best advise i can give is keep calm and dont worry when taking psychedelics. It'll open your mind and change your outlook on life and the way you view things. If you havent tried psychedelics, you dont know what your missing. I really love going to raves, bars and concerts while tripping. Often, ill carry some hits in my pocket waiting for the right moment to trip. Nothing like taking a hit, drinking some beer, smoking some weed, taking another hit and drinking more beer. Psychedelics are just an all round good time, especially LSD. Honesty, i dont know where i would be without them. Psychedelics made me who i am today
The absence of evidence is not proof. Here’s one small example: Matthew Roper in a FairMormon Blog on June 17, 2013, writes about a criticism repeated many times over the years about the mention of steel in the Book of Mormon. In 1884, one critic wrote, “Laban’s sword was steel, when it is a notorious fact that the Israelites knew nothing of steel for hundreds of years afterwards. Who but as ignorant a person as Rigdon would have perpetuated all these blunders.” More recently, Thomas O’Dea in 1957 stated, “Every commentator on the Book of Mormon has pointed out the many cultural and historical anachronisms, such as the steel sword of Laban in 600 B.C.” We had no answer to these critics at the time, but as often happens in these matters, new discoveries in later years shed new light. Roper reports, “It is increasingly apparent that the practice of hardening iron through deliberate carburization, quenching and tempering was well known to the ancient world from which Nephi came. ‘It seems evident,’ notes one recent authority, ‘that by the beginning of the tenth century B.C. blacksmiths were intentionally steeling iron.’” In 1987, the Ensign reported that archeologists had unearthed a long steel sword near Jericho dating back to the late seventh century B.C., probably to the reign of King Josiah who died shortly before Lehi began to prophesy. This sword is now on display at Jerusalem’s Israel Museum. The museum’s explanatory sign reads in part, “The sword is made of iron hardened into steel, attesting to substantial metallurgical know-how.” —Elder D. Todd Christofferson, "The Prophet Joseph Smith",
“With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea, for in the middle of their history there were those who left America in ships of their making and went to the islands of the sea. Not until the revelations of Joseph Smith, bringing forth the Book of Mormon, did anyone know of these migrants. It was not known before, but now the question is fully answered. Now the Lamanites number about sixty million; they are in all of the states of America from Tierra del Fuego all the way up to Point Barrows, and they are in nearly all the islands of the sea from Hawaii South to New Zealand … The descendants of this mighty people were called Indians by Columbus in 1492 when he found them here. The term Lamanite includes all Indians and Indian mixtures, such as Polynesians, the Guatemalans, the Peruvians, as well as the Sioux, the Apache, the Mohawk, the Navajo, and others. It is a large group of great people.” – Spencer W. Kimball, “Of Royal Blood,” Ensign July 1971. (Emphasis added)
“The research on Neanderthals and Denisovans clearly illustrates that if ancestors of other ethnic backgrounds are hiding unnoticed in our family trees, traces of their DNA can be found in our genomes. Even after tens of thousands of years. It is no longer reasonable to claim that Lamanite DNA cannot be found. The recent advances in whole genome sequencing and analysis have changed the research landscape. Genetic tests are now so sensitive, that it is possible to detect a tiny fraction of a percent of mixed ancestry in a person’s DNA.” “Let's suspend disbelief for a moment and consider that the apologists are on to something, and all the prophets have been misguided. Lehi and his small band colonize a restricted region of the Americas. The Book of Mormon records that Lehi's descendants multiplied exceedingly and spread upon the face of the land. Their Middle Eastern nuclear DNA would have spread, over the last 3,000 years, throughout adjacent populations like a drop of ink in a bucket of water. At the very least their genes would have spread over many hundreds of kilometres. It would be exceedingly unlikely that their genomic DNA would go extinct and scientists exploring the genomes of Native Americans would stumble on it if it was there. But apparently the Lamanite generation, along with their genes, are nowhere to be found beyond the pages of the Book of Mormon."
If the Book of Mormon is historical and the geography, for example, is real, then it is not unreasonable for Mormon scholars to put together – based on the data – of a potential location of one single Book of Mormon land. It is not unreasonable to then publish for peer-review this data in a non-Mormon journal that is not BYU-controlled. It is not unreasonable to have other archaeologists, anthropologists, and other experts to peer review the data. This is the scientific process which was used to find the lost city of Troy. This is the same scientific process that can lead to the discovery of Zarahemla. Unfortunately for the Church and its apologists, decades of vigorous archaeological and anthropological research has yielded nothing. This is also the same scientific process that was used to find the thousand-year-old Viking outpost in Canada. Quite frankly, it is beyond ridiculous that we can find a tiny Viking outpost in Canada which consisted of people who landed a thousand years ago in a very remote part of the Americas but we cannot find a trace of a massive Nephite/Lamanite civilization which numbered in the millions. It’s insane that a civilization roughly the size of the Roman Empire, spanning a time frame of 1,000 years, just completely vanished into thin air without a trace. The Romans left roads, aqueducts, coins, buildings, independent historical accounts, etc. all over Europe and the Mediterranean.
Response: This is a great case study of FairMormon disingenuity. First of all, notice how FairMormon provides their source for this. They put a footnote “1” that links to their “Endnotes” section on the bottom as opposed to just directly linking to the website as FairMormon has for other sources, such as town websites, Wikipedia, and the maps. Also notice that FairMormon does not put a page number in their source at the bottom in the “Endnotes.” There is a reason for this. Here is what it actually says in the source: “The fact that Rama Township grew in fits and starts is reflected in the piecemeal fashion it was surveyed into settlement lots. One third of the township – the west side, bordering Lake Couchiching – was surveyed in 1834 by William Keating.” (Emphasis added) Isn’t that interesting? This is quite different from FairMormon’s “first surveyed in 1834” claim, isn’t it? There’s a difference between “one third of the township – the west side” being surveyed in 1834 versus the entire town “first” being surveyed in 1834. Further, here’s the most important part from page 8 that FairMormon decided to omit from their readers: “The name Rama was already used for the area in 1826, when the Black River was first surveyed.” So, FairMormon is incorrect in their claim about Rama. The name was already being used for the area in 1826; several years before the publication of the Book of Mormon. FairMormon has lost significant credibility here. If FairMormon were a witness on the stand, any lawyer worth his/her salt would have had a heyday impeaching FairMormon over this deception.
There is a lot of meditation on the media I am interested in. House of Leaves remediated film and Only Revolutions remediated music. The Fifty-Year Sword does campfire stories. Television series began to play a role. It wasn’t a magical insight. You and I watched this cultural presence emerge and become pervasive. People were saying, “We are watching novels for the first time in way that film could never do. Then you have examples like The Wire, where the pacing was about character. It wasn’t about tearing up stories. It wasn’t about creating an entire story in just one episode, which was the old mode for serial books. It may be a long-running detective series, but each book contained its own mystery and its own solution, and maybe there would be an overarching villain. Then The Wire came along and showed a different kind of pace. There was a combination of an appreciation for a series like The Wire or The Sopranos, or Battlestar Galactica. It influenced my view on how this whole thing would unfold. In that sense I became more and more committed, seeing what each character could do, and what that involved with the structure itself. I think I was toying with it, how it was going to work. I think the boldness was in allowing the characters to proceed within the story as they now proceed, as you have experienced them. Certainly, you could tell the whole story in ten pages. You could accelerate it. You could have one of those shows that rapidly eat up plot points. In the devouring, you eat up all the nutrients.
Danielewski: It’s a big question. Particular to Xanther, over the nine years, the design changed. I was trying to settle on what would be right. The name and the look of the font is important. These changes are constantly going on. I am designing the text as I am writing. It is not like you write the text, then design it. They go hand in hand. When these moments accelerate, there is less text on the page. The meanings have to be more concentrated. You can be more verb heavy in terms of action, or you can be more poetic. There are times when I changed the font and that radically affected the number of words on the page, and that changed everything and suddenly her voice changed. There is a lot of that. She hears this cat through the three pink ellipses. One of the parts that always gets me about Xanther is the thought of writing twenty-seven volumes with her at the center is that this is the greatest privilege that I can imagine. I will be so lucky if I get to do this. All the characters in the book hear the cat, but she’s the one that answers and leaps from the car, and she goes to get it. All of the other characters are chosen, but she’s the one that answers. That’s the heart of the book for the writer and the reader. Do you answer the call?
Danielewski: Sure. It’s a point, a nexus, where the literal and historic, prophetic and prescriptive and the symbolic combine. Yes, we are talking about a child, but we have these young ideas at all ages, that if nurtured and cared for, can go up to bigger and better things. They may be as significant as a little impulse that a fifty-year-old woman has been holding on to, that she can nurture, and suddenly become this little gleam ten years later, and change her life in a way that is inspiring for everyone. Through a lot of practice of my own, whether it is physical practice like tai chi or yoga, it is this constant place of finding newness and beginnerness. A child is emblematic of that. It is a time when we are formed by powerful ideas and may be prejudiced by these ideas. From an early age, we are prejudicially slotted to a certain viewpoint. We always have an opportunity to engender a different viewpoint, yet it is very easy not to. It is this point when habits that start to reinforce bad things as well as good things have not quite formed or set, and there is an openness. There is such a vitality. At the same time, there is an age in The Familiar… it is very difficult for me to see the book as you see the book, for so much more of it is in place in my head, which I know is not in Volume I.
Danielewski: A lot of it is providential introductions to people. I’ve ended that cloistered, monastic part of my life as a writer, and I want to be much more open to the variables of change, and that took a lot more doing. I had to change aspects of my personality, further amplified by the examples of Salinger and Pynchon. Suddenly I said, “Let’s open the doors, let’s open the windows here.” That began to take place with The Fifty-Year Sword. I depended on other people and that led to introductions. It required personal openness that was very hard for me. I could be at a barbecue and start talking to someone. For some reason, this guy opened up to me about life in “La Pinta” [the LA Mexican gangs] and in jail. That led into Luther’s world. A lot of the taxi cab drivers in LA are Armenian. Suddenly, I was talking to them and having great conversations. You have this horrendous English, but through it you get these tremendous stories of the Armenian genocide, which was being echoed now. It is also about not getting confused by the small things, but focusing on the larger issues, the blunt subject of each chapter.
Danielewski: It was. In some ways, it is the heart of the book. It was the heart of the last nine years of writing. It was the inevitable part that she was going to find something. The incredible velocity when you are finding something or losing something, the sense of elation that gives you purpose, that can drive Xanther through her run. I wonder if what readers are responding to, which is in the book, is the sense of loss that the parents feel they are losing her. They also understand that she is changing, that she is growing up, that there is an underlying tension that their daughter is starting to become who she is in a way they can’t control. This moment is literalized. Anwar experiences not only losing her, but for a moment is unaware of her leaving the car, because he is focused on the rain, the traffic and where they are going. Xanther is not losing Anwar. There is no point where she is thinking of him. Xanther is thinking of the purpose that she can hold on to through everything that will come at her. She’s just ahead of everything that will ask of her to fail. There is the reprieve that she grants to something that is voiceless and unknown. It is very moving. I feel those seizures of information that Xanther has. For me, it is the most effective part of the book. I am gratified by the early response of readers. I was moved writing it.

Create a funnel only when there is a well-defined path you can see/expect your website users to follow, to complete your website goal. If a website goal (like file downloads) can be easily achieved, by following dozens of different paths, then do not define a funnel. If you do, it won’t help you much in understanding how different traffic segments convert. Instead create filtered views (like one view for organic traffic, one for paid search, one for social media etc). I am often asked the question: How do I decide pages for my funnel? The answer is pretty simple, use those pages as funnel pages, which are most frequently viewed prior to goal completions and/or transactions. Use the page value metric to determine such pages. You can also use the ‘Reverse Goal Path’ report (under Conversions > Goals in your GA view) to determine the actual navigation paths that triggered goal conversions, and the number of conversions each navigation path triggered. By default the ‘Reverse goal path’ report, shows the last 3 steps, user took, before viewing the goal page. The navigation path that has triggered maximum number of conversions, should be used as a funnel. You can also apply advanced segments to the ‘reverse goal path’ report. Note: You can only create funnels for URL based goals. So if you want to create funnels for event based goals then you need to use virtual pageviews. You can learn more about virtual pageviews from this article: Event Tracking & Virtual pageviews in Google Analytics – Complete Guide
Issue #3: Using the Same Goal Page for Different Funnels If you want to set up different funnels for same goal, then consider using different goal URLs for each individual funnel. For example, let’s say, you want to understand, how people who view the service1 page, convert in comparison to the people, who view the service2 page on your website. Now you need to set up two different goals and two different funnels in your GA view, to understand this conversion behavior. Let us suppose the URI of the goal page for the two funnels is ‘/thank-you/‘. So the first goal and its corresponding funnel setup, could look something like the one below: The second goals and its corresponding funnel setup, could look something like the one below: Now once you start collecting the data for the two goals, you will discover that the goal completions and goal conversion rate for both goals are reported the same, by Google Analytics: This happened because, both goal completions and goal conversion rate is independent of the funnel steps. To fix this problem, you need to use different goal page URL for the two goals: ‘/thank-you-service1/‘ , ‘/thank-you-service2/‘ After such setup, you would see correct number of Goal completions and accurate goal conversion rate for each goal and funnel. Issue #4: Capitalization Issues If you want to make the goal page URI and funnel page URIs to exactly match the capitalization of visited URLs then you need to check the ‘case-sensitive’ check box while setting up a funnel:
Like in our case, there is a 100% continuation rate from shopping cart page to check out page and 100% continuation rate from checkout page to the order review page. This usually happens when multiple funnel steps, match same web pages. If you look at the funnel set up above, the first step is the home page (/) which matches with all other funnel pages, as they all contain ‘/’. This is because of the ‘regular expression’ match type, selected for the URL destination goal ( which is /completed-purchase.php) The match type (like ‘Regular Expression’, ‘Begins With’, ‘Equal to’) you select for URL destination goal is continued throughout the funnel set up. So if you select ‘regular expression’ match for the URL destination goal then it will be the same match type for each funnel step. Similarly, if you select ‘Begins with’ match for the URL destination goal then it will be the same match type for each funnel step. Remember funnel steps can accept regular expressions. In order to solve the 100% continuation issue, in the funnel visualization report here, you need to re-write the regex for the goal page and each of the funnel page. Another Example, if the goal URL is /.*/signup\.php Then Google Analytics can match this regex, with signup page in any directory. For example the goal URL will match the following URLs: https://www.abc.com/signup.php
#10 Never Ignore Data Sampling Issues while Reading Funnel Report If you manage a high traffic website (million of pageviews each month) then you simply can’t afford to ignore data sampling issues. When Google Analytics is sampling your data badly, you can’t blindly rely on the metrics reported by it. Then there is always a strong possibility, that the reported metrics are 10 to 80% off the mark. If your funnel visualization report is based on more than 100k sessions then Google Analytics is going to sample the data, whether or not you use GA Premium. So in order to fix data sampling issues, run the funnel visualization report, for shorter time frame which should include less than 100k sessions. To learn more about data sampling issues in Google Analytics, read the article: Google Analytics Data Sampling – Complete Guide #11 Never Use a Small Time Frame and a Small Data Set for your Funnel Analysis Many marketers take marketing decisions based on small time frame or small data set. You can’t determine the best conversion path used by your website users and then optimize your conversion funnel, just on the basis of few weeks of data or handful of conversions. You need at least one month of data in your funnel visualization report before you can take marketing decisions or even consider funnel optimization. If you have a low traffic website, getting enough conversions in the desired time frame is difficult. Your best bet is, to buy some extra traffic (via PPC or ads on social media) so that you can validate your tests/assumptions faster. Make sure that you always use descriptive names for funnel steps as they show up in your funnel visualization reports. Use a name which describes what the goal /funnel page is all about. Don’t use names like ‘step-1’, ‘step-2’ etc.
In order to better understand the Checkout abandonment rate, segment this metric to its most granular level using Google Analytics filtered views.When Sept. 11, 2001, dawned, the Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome, N.Y., went on full alert — to prepare for a training exercise that envisioned a sneak attack by Russian planes flying over the North Pole to bomb the United States, a prospect that Defense Secretary Robert McNamara had dismissed as outdated in 1966. Later that morning, after American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 had hit the World Trade Center and American Airlines Flight 77 the Pentagon, three F-16 fighter jets were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base to form a combat air patrol over Washington. But degraded radio transmission quality meant that the pilots were left clueless about the nature of their mission. On seeing the Pentagon in flames, the lead fighter pilot later explained, “I reverted to the Russian threat. . . . I’m thinking cruise missile threat from the sea. You know, you look down and see the Pentagon burning, and I thought the bastards snuck one by us. . . . You couldn’t see any airplanes, and no one told us anything.”
Opponents of the Electoral College system also point to the risk of so-called "faithless" Electors. A "faithless Elector" is one who is pledged to vote for his party's candidate for president but nevertheless votes of another candidate. There have been 7 such Electors in this century and as recently as 1988 when a Democrat Elector in the State of West Virginia cast his votes for Lloyd Bensen for president and Michael Dukakis for vice president instead of the other way around. Faithless Electors have never changed the outcome of an election, though, simply because most often their purpose is to make a statement rather than make a difference. That is to say, when the electoral vote outcome is so obviously going to be for one candidate or the other, an occasional Elector casts a vote for some personal favorite knowing full well that it will not make a difference in the result. Still, if the prospect of a faithless Elector is so fearsome as to warrant a Constitutional amendment, then it is possible to solve the problem without abolishing the Electoral College merely by eliminating the individual Electors in favor of a purely mathematical process (since the individual Electors are no longer essential to its operation).
Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel's son was stopped from boarding a Qatar Airways flight early on Monday after he arrived in a "heavily drunken" state and argued with the staff at the airport.Jaiman Patel, who is in his mid-30s, along with his wife Jhalak and daughter Vaishvi were stopped from boarding the plane, which was scheduled to take-off at 4am, official sources told news agency IANS. The family was headed to Greece for a vacation.Mr Patel, who is a land dealer, reached the Ahmedabad International Airport in a drunken state, barely able to walk.He cleared the immigration and other checks in a wheelchair due to his inebriated condition, said airport officials."Jaimin Patel was prevented from boarding the flight. He also had an argument with the staff of the airways," an official said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, Nitin Patel told reporters in the evening in Gandhinagar that this was a ploy to defame him. "My son, his wife and daughter were going for a vacation. He was not feeling well.""His wife called up home and then it was decided to return home and not proceed," the 60-year-old minister added. "Our opponents are trying to tarnish our image by spreading false and mischievous information," he said.Antimatter Now and Later
Edward Isaac-Dovere of Politico has the scoop: As Democrats aim to capitalize on this year’s Republican turmoil and start building back their own decimated bench, former Attorney General Eric Holder will chair a new umbrella group focused on redistricting reform—with the aim of taking on the gerrymandering that’s left the party behind in statehouses and made winning a House majority far more difficult. The new group, called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, was developed in close consultation with the White House. President Barack Obama himself has now identified the group—which will coordinate campaign strategy, direct fundraising, organize ballot initiatives and put together legal challenges to state redistricting maps—as the main focus of his political activity once he leaves office. The group is moving forward in a systematic way, assembling talent and money: Though initial plans to be active in this year’s elections fell short, the group has been incorporated as a 527, with Democratic Governors Association executive director Elizabeth Pearson as its president and House Majority PAC executive director Ali Lapp as its vice president. They’ve been pitching donors and aiming to put together its first phase action plan for December, moving first in the Virginia and New Jersey state elections next year and with an eye toward coordination across gubernatorial, state legislative and House races going into the 2018 midterms. Redistricting, aka Gerrymandering (depending on the eye of the beholder), is now a science, thanks to the data-mining capabilities of all the Silicon Valley Big Money corporatist allies of the Democrats. Assembling masses of data from Google, Facebook, and others, they can put together districts micro-targeted with just enough Democrats to win and shove the GOP voters into 90% majority districts, shut out forever from control of state legislatures and the House of Representatives. As Richard Baehr emailed me, "so long as there is an opposition, it must be destroyed." It will be, if these well designed, politically connected, well financed efforts are implemented under a President Rodham. Combined with a Supreme Court committed to the living Constitution fantasy, the Uniparty will rule us all any way it desires.1 / 6 Radiation Reaching The U.S.
What I do know is that on September 13th, about eighty women gathered at Speakers Corner — a significant and historic place of free speech and open debate — in order to attend a talk being given about a proposed act of parliament which will see gender identity replace gender reassignment as a protected characteristic under the law. So instead of requiring a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a medical certificate, and to have lived as your chosen gender for a minimum of two years, an individual will be able to simply declare themselves the opposite sex and sign a statement of intention to live as such, making the process far easier, quicker, and much less intrusive. The act represents a gargantuan table flip in how we understand ourselves as humans: our sexual dimorphism, reproductive biology, and how we organise ourselves in the public and private spheres. When an individuals sex is defined, not by distinct and measurable physical characteristics, but by their subjective internal feelings about gender, what implications does this have for the category of humans who have been oppressed for centuries on the very basis of their biology? That is what the women gathering at Speakers Corner wished to discuss.
Disbelief and rage can fill me up like a hot balloon, but with deflation comes the bigger picture. There is nothing much new in the world and certainly the response of women to this crisis — and it absolutely is a crisis when women are being beaten in the name of women’s liberation — is ages old. My feminism is clear: male supremacy is, and always has been, the problem. Not women. We don’t make the rules. I have never blamed women for doing what they have to do to survive in a world run by men for men, although when we turn on each other it is painful. It has always been so. Girls in my life had begun to reinforce male supremacy before I had even begun to bleed. We called each other sluts and undermined each others academic achievements. We criticised each others bodies and clothing. During the time of the suffragettes, many women campaigned against their own right to vote. Today we tell other women, many of whom are survivors of male sexual violence, that if they voice any fear around having to share a changing room with a person who has a penis, they are deserving of yet more violence.
Twenty years ago, men who liked to live as women called themselves transsexual and knew perfectly well they were not “real” women. The change in definition to transwoman and the demand to be recognised as real women is in fact very recent. Socially conditioned to want to be supportive and inclusive, women for the most part took up the rallying cry of transwomen are women! But it wasn’t enough. We then had to accept that transwomen had always been women, even if transition had occurred in middle age and the individual had lived as a man, with all the privileges that brings, right up until that point. Now it is against the rules to ever mention any individuals name used prior to transition; their history must effectively be erased. And apparently that is still not enough. Transwomen now say they are biologically female; that biological sex as we understand it is a social construct and that their gender identity is the primary indicator of their biology, not their chromosomes or reproductive systems, thus turning on its head centuries of scientific givens. Going yet further, the idea that transwomen can have periods has become noticeably prevalent lately, with blogs detailing symptoms of PMT and women dutifully supplying sympathy and offers of back rubs.
As for the future of the company... there are several new Total War: Arena and Total War Battles: Kingdoms, along with a new Football Manager. More sad news today. Following up on the announcement that Joystiq and its related sites are shutting down, Sega also announced that they, too, are closing an office in San Francisco and downsizing their force as they move to Northern California. Sega is also moving away from major console releases and focusing on portable, mobile and online PC games. MCV UK is reporting that Sega has announced that 300 jobs have been on the chopping block and the company offered early retirement for those about to be unemployed.According to Sega...The move comes after the publisher consulted with the Group Structure Reform Division who advised Sega to reduce redundancies and offer early retirement for various employees. It was also the purpose of the division to help restructure Sega for profitability and management efficiency. Eurogamer also managed to get a quote about part of the restructuring process from the long-running software (and formerly hardware) publisher, who commented about any future reductions in job redundancy, saying...Sega had long been making a good deal of their revenue from their Japanese arcades or pachinko business. The company staying away from home consoles after the Saturn and Dreamcast bit the dust (amongst other consoles) made a lot of sense, but now that they're putting the big AAA business behind them... well, it's a little shocking and yet not all too surprising.Sega has suffered a string of unfortunate disasters in the home console space on the software front. There have been the numerousgames released that were questionable when it came to content, as well as controversial releases like Aliens: Colonial Marines , which caused Sega some issues on the legal.Recently, there wasandfor the Wii U, both of which scored rather low on the critical front and did just as poorly on the sales front. However, the company did have the recent success of Alien: Isolation and theseries that have done well for the company.Speaking of Football Manager and Alien: Isolation ... the Eurogamer article notes that both Sega Sports and Creative Assembly won't be affected much by the restructuring. Whether or not they will focus more on mobile titles and online PC games remains to be seen, but it's at least good that Creative Assembly isn't closing up shop. They did have their own little pow-wow back when Total War: Rome 2 launched and Angry Joe took a bite out of them for it.As for the future of the company... there are several new Total War games on the horizon, including Total War: Attila, and, along with a new Blended From Around The Web Facebook
The first series began on 25 May 2002. Each episode had a duration of thirty minutes. However, reruns of these episodes have been re-edited to the full hour and titled Most Haunted Unseen. Added footage in these episodes is shown with a caption in the corner to distinguish it from the original version. The series concluded with an investigation of Michelham Priory on 17 September 2002, which was coincidentally the first episode to be produced. In the eighth series the team revisited this location to mark the 100th episode. During the break in series, the team aired three live investigations, the third of which led into the second series on 8 April 2003. From this point onwards episodes were accompanied by a supplemental Most Haunted Extra. At this point, Extra was available as a ten-minute feature after the main show, accessible to viewers via the red button. For Series two and three, Phil Whyman joined the show as a paranormal investigator, replacing the original investigator Jason Karl of Lancashire as well as guest investigators Portsmouth native David Scanlan and Vicki Purewal who decided not to continue with the team, who left at the end of the first series. The show remained unchanged at this point until Series 4.
The eleventh series of Most Haunted began on 19 February 2008 and came to a close at the end of April.[7] This series featured three psychic mediums: Johnnie Fiori, Nottingham native Barrie John and Brian Shepherd. Lesley Smith replaced Richard Felix as the resident historian on the recorded shows and travelled with the team to each location. The team were also joined by Scottish paranormal investigator Ryan O'Neill, a guest on episodes 1&2 of series 10 at Coalhouse Fort.[8] In the Coalhouse Fort episodes of the show, an American psychic joined the team and claimed to have encountered the spirits of a bespectacled old man and his "gawky" son in the museum of the fort, who had been responsible for compiling the collection. The team allegedly picked up the voice and moaning from the old man later in the night.[9] The psychic also claimed that there were spirits of animals in the fort, perhaps from horses who had been involved in its construction and claimed to have encountered the spirit of a pilot named Jeff and other air force men around the fort who had been there during World War I.[9] She also claimed that in one area of the fort she picked up macabre images of debauchery and sodomy where sexual favours were performed in return for food and money, also from World War I.[9] The team also apparently picked up countless examples of poltergeist activity in the fort with the unexplained throwing of stones, knocking and the occasional moaning, responses from taunts by the team for the ghosts to make their presence known.[9]

The four-passenger Xenia was designed for the American market. With clean lines and loads of glass, the Xenia was also safely-designed, with a straight body line set over the car's 168-inch length and 40-inch height. At the rear, the taillights were placed very low on the rear bumper, under the large glass hatch incorporating the car's name in large letters. The windshield was extended down onto the cowl line for increased visibility. Also continuing this theme were side windows continuing downward. At the base of the windshield were solar battery cells which produced energy for the entertainment system and comfort features when the car wasn‘t running. All four pear-shaped seats were divided by a central transmission tunnel. All instruments were in visibility of only the driver, due to curved control panels behind the steering wheel, and concealing the information from all other passengers. Radio and ventilation controls were placed on the central transmission tunnel between the two front seas. The flat dashboard allowed items to be placed neatly. The steering wheel also sat in front of various square buttons in a telephone-like arrangement, controlling the car's entertainment center and vital functions. Rear occupants had use of the entertainment center, which included a video game system on the end of the transmission tunnel, an intercom, and a telephone.

There are so many great Springfield businesses that were important to the people who live here, just like CD Warehouse was to lots of music lovers in town. It’s been a fun trip down memory lane to recall the places we used to hang out, shop, do business and enjoy in the Queen City. Here are 50 businesses we really miss. Please let us know which business you miss most in the comments on Facebook!
Taken from https://pasttenseblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/today-in-londons-radical-history-mental-patients-union-founded-to-oppose-psychiatric-oppression-1973/We tested the hypothesis that curcumin supplementation would reverse arterial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress with aging. Young (Y, 4-6 months) and old (O, 26-28 months) male C57BL6/N mice were given normal or curcumin supplemented (0.2%) chow for 4 weeks (n=5-10/group/measure). Large elastic artery stiffness, assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), was greater in O (448±15 vs. 349±15 cm/s) and associated with greater collagen I and advanced glycation end-products and less elastin (all P<0.05). In O, curcumin restored aPWV (386±15 cm/s), collagen I and AGEs (AGEs) to levels not different vs. Y. Ex vivo carotid artery acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD, 79±3 vs. 94±2%), nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) were lower in O (all P<0.05). In O, curcumin restored NO-mediated EDD (92±2%) to levels of Y. Acute ex vivo administration of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic TEMPOL normalized EDD in O control mice (93±3%), but had no effect in Y control or O curcumin treated animals. O had greater arterial nitrotyrosine abundance, superoxide production and NADPH oxidase p67 subunit expression, and lower manganese SOD (all P<0.05), all of which were reversed with curcumin. Curcumin had no effects on Y. Curcumin supplementation ameliorates age-associated large elastic artery stiffening, NO-mediated vascular endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress and increases in collagen and AGEs in mice. Curcumin may be a novel therapy for treating arterial aging in humans.
“But, of course, the press, wanting to get reactions, they went to a couple of indie developers. In this case, Jonathan Blow and Phil Fish, because those guys are the self-styled kings of the indie genre. They’ve been on Indie Game: The Movie, and they’ll turn up and quote for anything and everyone. And Ms. Fish and Blow, or BlowFish as I’m going to call the two them right, because while they may be moderately tasty, they’re also kind of lethal. [They] decided to go bananas and bitch and moan to Game Informer, in particular about “How dare you, how dare you ask us questions about this story! I’m sick of you guys wanting my opinion on this story!” Both of them, both bitching away. And I’ve just got a little message for the BlowFish. Gents, you are the guys who did Indie Games: The Movie, and some of you looked relatively normal in it, one of you looked like a total tosspot in it. You can’t have it both ways. You’re successful game designers, you’re indie game designers--hurrah, good for you, you fucking hipsters. Let’s get something out of the way. If you are successful and you want people to promote your games, and you go to the press and give them quotes for anything that pertains to your shilling your next title, when the press, then, come to you and say “this is something that’s pertinent to the indie scene, let’s talk to BlowFish because BlowFish are successful and they are, you know, supposedly these pioneers” don’t get fucking snicky about it, alright? Jesus, you should be grateful that these guys consider what you say something of use.. Me? I think the both of you are a pair of tosspots. You may make good games. Well, Blow makes...Blow makes a good game. Fez, I’m just not into at all. I’m just not into it. I respect people that do [enjoy it]. My own personal opinion, though? Having seen these wankers over and over again, bitch and moan--Phil Fish in particular, though.
Six more cases of child sexual abuse have been filed against Manjunath, the employee of a private school in Bengaluru. The first police case against the 31-year-old was filed last week, after the parents of a child accused him of molesting their child. But now, more and more parents say they have found out why their child did not want to go to school. The children -- girls and boys - are barely more than toddlers."My daughter was crying for three weeks and pleading with us not to send her to the school," said a father. It took them some time to understand the reason. "She said 'Bhaiyya touches me'. We thought she meant other children... small children are playful," he said.The couple was horrified when the child explained that she had pain in her private parts. They stood at the school gates and shared their story. "More than 10, 12 parents came back and said their children were also going through it. And they confirmed it was Manju Bhaiyya," the child's mother said.One father said he was tortured by the thought that he had been forcing his child to go to school and face such abuse.The mother of a two-and-a-half year boy told NDTV, "For nearly a month, he has been complaining of a pain in his bottom. We gave him deworming medicine..."Manjunath has been arrested and charged under POCSO, the law that deals with sexual offences against children. The school administrators have also been charged with not complying with safety regulations.After the agitated parents met the city police chief, Praveen Sood told NDTV that the school had not been complying with the safety regulations ordered by the police department following a series of alleged sexual assaults two years ago. The school is now closed and the arrested administrators are out on bail. The parents, however, are not ready to let the matter drop. They said they were consulting lawyers and want further action against the school. "He has assured us....But only action will give us any kind of hope," said the father of one of the children.Remember that movie from the early 2000s, ‘I Heart Huckabees’? The main character, played by Jason Schwartzman, is curious about the constant coincidences in his life, so he hires a unorthodox duo of detectives help him figure out what they could mean.
I actually feel a bit mean putting this song as low as number 4. It kind of feels like Mokey’s unofficial theme song. It’s thoughtful and introspective, yet as with previous entries when Mokey is thoughtful and introspective it’s mostly with regard to her place in the wider universe. I’ve loved this song for years – I guess on a certain level it speaks to me personally. I think at times we’ve probably all asked these kinds of questions so this isn’t just a beautiful song it’s one that is totally relatable. It hasn’t been mentioned yet in this chart, but it blows my mind that what is essentially a kids show can have such thoughtful, poignant moments that ask such grown up questions. I know the hallmark of the best Jim Henson creations is that they can be enjoyed by all ages, but for me this show falls firmly between The Muppet Show and Sesame Street in terms of core audience age. I love that both Fraggle Rock and Sesame Street aren’t afraid to touch on such big subjects. Unlike some of the songs on the chart this is a proper length song coming in at around 3 minutes and Kathryn sounds amazing for every single second. This is a true tour de force.
Gobo “I’ll finish your song for you” Fraggle strikes again! At least this time he participates in more of the song, but Kathryn sings this song so beautifully that I feel affronted on her behalf that she doesn’t get to finish it. I guess it’s too late to storm The Henson Company with pitchforks to demand they re-shoot it. Oh well, let’s dwell on the positive instead and what a lot of positive there is. This song was so very, very nearly number 1 on the chart and if there wasn’t an iconic Mokey song to come it probably would have been. Kathryn sings this song to perfection. Her vocal style works brilliantly for a lullaby. The harmonies are lush and full and the song’s arrangement with the flute accompaniment is superb. I haven’t yet mentioned Philip Balsam and Dennis Lee who wrote not just this song, but most likely every Fraggle Rock song you’ve ever found yourself humming in the shower (please say it’s not just me). They totally deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Paul Williams and Joe Raposo as Muppet Music Maestros. When my acapella group were looking for a Fraggle Rock song to sing this was a very strong contender (we ultimately chose Dixie Wailin’).
Mokey’s Funeral is a classic episode of Fraggle Rock and this song in my opinion is also a Fraggle Rock classic. Kathryn sounds great here – again it’s a beautiful vocal that showcases her higher register fantastically, but unlike most other Mokey ballads her fun side comes to the fore here and this allows for a lighter, less serious delivery. This is as much as great vocal performance as an example of Kathryn’s outstanding acting or puppetry. There’s a real subtlety in this song. I know I’ve name checked her before, but if someone told me that this was a Kate Bush song I would believe them. I wish Fraggle Rock had released a few more singles while it was on air as I could totally imagine this as a standalone release. Aside from the actual song it’s interesting that Mokey calls Rags “pretty” when she was made in her own image. What does this say about Mokey’s ego? We know that she can be introspective from earlier entries, but it’s usually in relation to the wider world. Does this statement show another side to her character? Am I reading too much into it? Is she just having fun? Can Batman and The Boy Wonder escape The Joker’s clutches? I just don’t know.

TAGUIG, Philippines – (UPDATED 1-Oct-14 19:33) A video showing Bonifacio Global City guards restraining a Caucasian man at the corner of 5th and 30th Avenue in BGC at 5:24PM on Saturday September 27 has been uploaded to YouTube in what can be considered a classic case ofpolice brutality.The video shows an un-armed Caucasian man wearing a light-colored polo shirt, khaki shorts, and blue sneakers being manhandled by at least seven uniformed officers while another one lay still, just a few meters away. Initially he was being restrained by two Bonifacio Global City guards, and two more quickly join the fray.A marshal wearing only the standard black and orange guard uniform(no reflector) can be seen punching the Caucasian man in the stomach. A few seconds later he is surrounded and being forced onto the floor, his body pink and sore and his clothes all torn.In the confusion, one of the guards can be heard saying “posasan mo!” (cuff him) while the white keeps on saying “I’d like you … I’d like you … yes … it’s okay … it’s okay”.At the end of the video, one of the guards can be seen approaching the cameraman while shouting “hoy! putang ina mo ah! huy bakla!” (hey! you son of a bitch! you faggot!).Bonifacio Global City, Taguig contains a very high presence of expatriates from other countries due to the presence of business establishments and BPO (business process outsourcing) companies.Just two best friends on vacationAccording to our source, the two are English best friends Sam & Chris. Sam is a BGC resident and Chris is staying for vacation.Here’s what happened before this incident:The English men’s names are Sam & Chris, two of the nicest people I’ve known in the city. Sam is a resident of BGC & Chris is his best friend who’s here for vacation. Sam just wished to use his skateboard and have fun that Saturday Afternoon Sept 27. They initially played in front of Banana Republic along fifth avenue, two lady police women approached them and nicely told them that they can’t use the board in that area and they instructed them to play at the park instead, which they did.At the park, a lady marshal the one shown in the video with a proud look at 1:16 stopped them rudely unlike the police women. As per Sam’s sharing, in their country they look up to their police officers as kings, they respected them and honour them, so their words were gold. So between the police women & the marshals, they believed the words of the police. They insisted to the marshal that they were told that it is okey to skate in that area and that’s where the argument began.Marshal called for back-up and two Big Marshals arrived, confiscated the skate board, in Sam’s mind he just want to get the skateboard and run off as he was already scared, which he successfully did. Then new set of reinforcements arrive and this video is what happened next. They got caught.Given, that the marshals’ were right that it is indeed prohibited to skate although ironically, to play IN A PARK, does it have to end this way? Where’s the maximum tolerance ruling? Oh maybe this marshals have a different code. We don’t need to be an investigator to figure out that there is something wrong here, they already got him but still the marshals had a grand time I guess showing off their kickboxing skills.To make it even worse, Sam, with a bruised face and a broken rib and Chris were arrested for being charged with PHYSICAL INJURY by two of this wonderful marshals. Really clever and wise move. They got detained that very night. Our experience with the investigating team made the night evenworse. Few CLOSED DOOR briefings with the complainants (the marshals) and the police happened that night investigator needed to ask what happened, we were waiting for our turn to be asked about our side but it never came. This is where I realized, you are really at a loss if youdon’t know anyone. Even if you are the one being aggravated, they can easily manipulate the situation and make it appear like you were in the wrong. I realized, it is very heavy for someone to be in this situation.For some reason they weren’t allowed to file a counter-charge that very night and we weren’t able to do anything to prevent them from detaining the two. Where in fact, Sam & Chris, were supposed to be the one filing that PHYSICAL INJURY CASE. If there’s any lawyer reading this we would really appreciate your advice sirs and madams.Sam is currently confined in St. Lukes & Chris is being held at Taguig Police Station just beside City hall of Taguig as suspects.Vermont Beer Makers Bring Back Old-Time Maple Sap Brews
Entering free agency in 2012, the Knicks had four long-term contracts in place: the big-three of Anthony, Stoudemire, and Chandler, along with Iman Shumpert’s rookie deal, for a 2015 total of just under $64,000,000. By the time of the Lin decision Jason Kidd had already been added, adding another $3,090,000, and the Marcus Camby trade had been agreed to and a contract was being worked out that would eventually extend to 2015, but of that, only $646,609 was guaranteed, effectively making it, for tax purposes, a minimum contract slot hold. Also, during the Lin deliberations, the Knicks allowed Landry Fields to leave for Toronto, but agreed to a long-term contract with Steve Novak that would add another $3,445,947 toward the 2015 pot. And, of course, in the frantic days that surrounded Lin’s departure, replacement Ray Felton was added for four years, including $3,793,693 to the all-important 2015 figure. The rest of the roster was then fleshed out with short-term minimum salaries (with the lone exception of JR Smith’s more complicated 1 year deal), bringing the 2015 total to $74,287,896. If Dolan had decided to match on Lin, and had kept all other moves the same (including bringing in Felton for linsurance), the 2015 projected total would have been $89,087,896, significantly above the tax threshold.

Time for another travel post 🙂 Out of all the things we saw and did in Spain, the Palo Alto market in Barcelona was on of our favorites. This wasn’t like any other street market that we’ve ever been too. Other street markets often feel a little repetitive and lack variety and creativity, but this market was nothing like that. The Palo Alto Market is based on the popular concept of a street market, but with a modern and creative twist that makes it unique and fresh. From a vast variety of food, art and products of all kinds there is something for everyone at Palo Alto. Everything was so colorful and the whole place looked like a piece of art. You could really tell the vendors here were passionate and excited about what they were sharing with us. We spent almost 5 hours there shopping, meeting new people and trying all the delicious food that we could get out hands on. This charming little market only happens on the first weekend of every month and we were so lucky to have been in Barcelona at the time to experience it! Click here to find out more about the market.Every year about this time, Craig Mundie, Microsoft’s chief research and strategy officer, holds an intimate gathering to discuss the company’s vision for the future: just Craig, a handful of Microsoft thinkers and select media convening for a lively show-and-tell discussion called TechForum.
Web posted at: 3:46 p.m. EST (2046 GMT) (CNN) -- Kevin David Mitnick -- once the most wanted computer hacker in the world, the inspiration for two Hollywood movies and a cyberspace cult hero -- had been scheduled to stand trial April 20 in Los Angeles in one of the most celebrated computer-related cases in history. But it was announced Thursday that Mitnick has signed a plea agreement that reportedly will set him free after serving another year in prison. He has been incarcerated since February 1995 on a 25-count indictment that includes charges of wire fraud and illegal possession of computer files stolen from such companies as Motorola and Sun Microsystems. Mitnick was arrested after what Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Painter called "a countrywide hacking spree" that earned Mitnick a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Over a 2 1/2-year period, Mitnick was alleged to have hacked into computers, stolen corporate secrets, scrambled phone networks, broken into the national defense warning system and caused millions of dollars in losses. Shimomura After being tracked down in a dramatic bit of cyber-sleuthing by computer expert Tsutomu Shimomura, Mitnick was arrested by the FBI in a nondescript apartment complex in Raleigh, North Carolina. In a 25-count indictment brought in Los Angeles, Mitnick was charged with computer and wire fraud and had been held without bail since his arrest. He was believed to have been held longer without a trial than any other prisoner in the United States. "He's a danger to the community," said Painter. "We're talking about someone who has consistently and without self-control hacked into systems everywhere. He also was a fugitive and used multiple identities. We think there's a firm basis for holding him, and the courts have agreed." 'Murderers ... have suffered less'
But others believed that Mitnick, who had become a kind of cult hero, was being held unfairly and that the government was trying to make an example of him. People claiming to be Mitnick supporters hacked into The New York Times and Yahoo! Web sites, demanding that Mitnick be freed. A bumper sticker that said "Free Kevin" was also widely distributed. Steve Gold, news editor of Secure Computing magazine and a former hacker himself, told The Independent of London: "For all that he's done, there are despots and murderers out there who have suffered less than Kevin." Mitnick, 35, grew up in a blue-collar family in California's San Fernando Valley. His parents divorced when he was 3 and, although shy and overweight, Mitnick demonstrated a genius for beating the system even as an adolescent. At 13, he figured out how to punch bus tickets and get free rides. He graduated to ham radios and then became a phone "phreaker" -- using an electronic device to make free, long-distance calls -- before getting caught stealing computer manuals from Pacific Bell as a juvenile and being put on probation. Aside from that case and the plea bargain, Mitnick has been found guilty in three other cases and sentenced to nearly three years in prison. Still pending are state charges related to Mitnick's alleged hacking into California Department of Motor Vehicles computers in 1992. Inspiration for 'War Games' Mitnick first received national attention in 1982 when he hacked into the North American Defense Command (NORAD), a feat that inspired the 1983 film "War Games." Also during the 1980s, he gained temporary control of three central telephone offices in New York City and all the phone switching centers in California. None of these incidents resulted in criminal charges. But patience with his pranks ran out after he hacked into computers at Digital Equipment Corp. and stole $1 million in proprietary software. Mitnick pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in a low-security prison and three years of probation. But his attorneys convinced U.S. District Court Judge Mariana Pfaelzer that Mitnick had an addiction and she ordered that he serve his sentence in a halfway house for those with compulsive disorders. Mitnick eventually took a job with a computer security firm, but was accused of violating the terms of his probation by hacking into voice mail systems at Pacific Bell in 1991. The federal government got a warrant for his arrest in 1992, and it was then that he became a fugitive. Caging 'The Condor' Mitnick is said to have used the name "Condor," after the Robert Redford character in the movie "Three Days of the Condor," during his time on the run. During that period, he allegedly hacked into computers at Motorola, Nokia Mobile Phones, Fujitsu, Novell, NEC, Sun Microsystems, Colorado SuperNet and the University of Southern California. Painter declined to estimate the damages, but media reports have put them as high as $80 million. His undoing was hacking into computer expert Shimomura's home computer and stealing information from him. "Takedown" documents the pursuit and arrest of Kevin Mitnick Infuriated, Shimomura helped the FBI track Mitnick down using laptop computers and a cell phone direction finder. Shimomura and New York Times reporter John Markoff collaborated on a book about Mitnick's capture, "Takedown." A film version of "Takedown" is in "post-production," according to a spokesman for Miramax Films. No release date has been set. 'He's got a very curious mind' Mitnick's defenders have maintained he was harmless, a hacker for whom the challenge was intellectual and technological. "Mitnick isn't a thief or a terrorist," said his attorney, Donald Randolph. "He's a recreational hacker. He didn't do it for economic gain or damage anything, and there's no allegation that he attempted to damage anything." "He's got a very curious mind," said his grandmother, Reba Vartanian. "He's never destroyed anything. He loves technology, he wouldn't hurt it." But prosecutor Painter said that "in any hacking case, security has been breached. That means you have to take steps to wipe clean and change the paths of the system. That's substantial in itself. And if the victim is in an ongoing business, and they have lost proprietary material they need to maintain a competitive advantage, there may be serious losses attributable to that. "Even if they're doing it for the glory of it, it ignores the point: If someone breaks into your house for the fun of it, you still suffer." Adds Shimomura: "[Mitnick] left a lot of proprietary information where other people could get it. That's like someone breaking into your house, then leaving it unlocked and putting a sign outside." Computer without a modem Randolph said he believed the government was being especially harsh with Mitnick to discourage hackers and cyberterrorists. "If they really had a terrorist who had a name like Mitnick does, and if he was convenient to the government, they would divert their interest," Randolph said. "But he's the best game in town." Despite the non-violent nature of his crimes and the charges in the upcoming case, Mitnick has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, where inmates are often held for violent crimes. His appeals for bail have been turned down by every court they've been sent to, including twice by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mitnick's trial had been delayed several times due its complexity, and often at the request of the defense. Randolph said Mitnick's limited access to a computer has hampered his efforts to assist in his defense. Randolph tried repeatedly to get Mitnick a computer so he could review evidence that reportedly includes witness statements totaling 1,400 pages, 10 gigabytes of electronic evidence and 1,700 exhibits in all. But after one hearing, Randolph told reporters that Judge Pfaelzer "didn't seem to want to hear 'computer' and 'Mitnick' in the same sentence." The court ultimately allowed Mitnick access to a laptop, but it was in a room for attorney-client meetings, and he was always monitored by someone from Randolph's office. And there was no modem or phone line. 'Foolishly paranoid' In the meanwhile, Mitnick has been serving out a 14-month sentence for violating his probation in the Digital break-in and eight months for a 1995 North Carolina charge of possession of an unauthorized access device. "Kevin's problem is that he has been convicted multiple times," said journalist Markoff. "Whatever you think of his crime, he has tripped the relevant federal guidelines. And the judge gave him a break before. Now he's before her again for another series of federal crimes." Vartanian said the government was "foolishly paranoid" about her grandson, who calls her in Las Vegas every day -- collect. "I just feel if they would only permit him to get gainful employment in this field, he would be an asset to the community and to the youth who look up to him," Vartanian said. "I know he's gotten into some difficulties, but never to harm anybody." Randolph said Mitnick has matured "significantly" and "would like somehow to be gainfully employed in computer security issues." As to whether he can be trusted when he is freed, Randolph said, "How can you trust any ex-con? The answer is you have to be satisfied that he's been rehabilitated as to what he did wrong, and then you move on." "He's been in a bad place for rehab the last couple of years," says Markoff. "But he's been such a symbol in society, maybe he'll find a situation where he can re-enter. There are a lot of people who want to support him, and that's a good thing. I hope Kevin gets his life together." Coming March 26 Insurgency on the Internet: An in-depth special on hacking and computer security MESSAGE BOARDS: Internet hackers

374. If I own a Kalashnikov product, is that product blocked by sanctions? Am I able to resell a Kalashnikov product at a gun show or other secondary market? If a U.S. person is in possession of a Kalashnikov Concern product that was bought and fully paid for prior to the date of designation (i.e., no payment remains due to Kalashnikov Concern), then that product is not blocked and OFAC sanctions would not prohibit the U.S. person from keeping or selling the product in the secondary market, so long as Kalashnikov Concern has no interest in the transaction. New transactions by U.S. persons with Kalashnikov Concern are prohibited, however, and any property in which Kalashnikov Concern has an interest is blocked pursuant to OFAC’s designation of Kalashnikov Concern on July 16, 2014. If a U.S. person has an inventory of Kalashnikov Concern products in which Kalashnikov Concern has an interest (for example, the products are not fully paid for or are being sold on consignment), we advise that U.S. person to contact OFAC for further guidance on handling of the inventory.

Imagine if American troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan were formally charged with raping 3,374 local women a year in places like Fallujah, Baghdad, and Kabul.The international outcry would make the one that followed Abu Ghraib look like the mewling of a kitten. Scandal and dishonor would follow the perpetrators to the end of their days and be written tens of pages deep into Google, as well as the history books. The secretary of defense and the president would take abrupt and decisive action to restore order in the ranks and reassert a demand for moral conduct and respect for the rights of women. The courts martial would flow.Instead, because Americans troops stationed around the world are charged with sexually assaulting fellow Americans who are also members of the Armed Forces, rather than civilians, their crimes have for too long been swept under the rug of national security and chain of command.Of 3,374 reported cases of sexual assault in 2012, only 238 convictions were handed down, according to the annual Department of Defense report to Congress released Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Pentagon's anonymous surveys of members of the military led it to estimate that more than 26,000 women and men were sexually assaulted in the U.S. Armed Forces last year. That number represents a sharp jump from the previous year's estimate of 19,000 assaults. (In the wake of the growing attention to the problem of military sexual assault, thanks in part to the release of the documentary Invisible War last year, some of that increase may be due to greater willingness of assault survivors to speak up about what they've experienced -- something the Pentagon says it wants them to do.)The basic problem with the military justice system in cases of sexual assault -- as outlined in horrific detail by the military women and experts featured inand by members of Congress during hearings -- is that it combines the dynamics of the workplace with the problem of crime investigation. A woman who is assaulted and wants redress has to report the crime to her commanding officer -- her boss -- and press charges against one of her colleagues in the military, often someone who also works for her boss, all the while continuing to live near her attacker in a thick soup of overlapping interpersonal and professional relationships between her and his friends. The commanding officer, in turn, is held responsible for crimes committed in his unit, and penalized if a flood of reports and convictions come in, as they are seen as a negative reflection on his leadership. And it's entirely up to him whether or not to push forward with taking a complaint to trail; he also has power to overturn convictions without explanation. Adding insult to injury, women seeking to bring charges may fall afoul of military codes punishing adultery and can face court martial themselves. In short, the system is a mess, resulting in what critics call a culture of impunity in which serial rapists are allowed to flourish I say serial rapists advisedly, because there's a great deal of research showing that far from being a mistake perpetrated by basically decent guys who fall afoul of the consent line one time, most rapists are serial predators who commit a large number of offenses before being convicted for one of them. Studies of civilians convicted of rape show that the average convicted rapist is responsible for seven to 11 sexual assaults, and that undetected rapists who prey on people they know also tend to be serial predators and approach their victims with a great deal of premeditation. The more we have learned about the nature of sexual predation, the more it becomes clear that it is pattern behavior by a small minority of men that if not caught and prosecuted too often is repeated. And women in the military are like women in college -- in the age range at which sexual predation against them is highest, housed in close proximity to men too young or clever to have been previously convicted, and forced by their environment to seek redress within a system of justice that bears little resemblance to the regular legal system. No wonder 62 percent of military women report experiencing social, professional, or administrative retaliation after reporting a sexual assault.More than a year afterbegan the conversation, and days after the Pentagon report was released, there is new high-level attention on how to address the problem."For those who areuniform who have experienced sexual assault,-i-chief that've gotbacks.will support," President Obama said Tuesday. "And we're not goingtolerate this stuff and there will be accountability." On Thursday, senior White House aides Valerie Jarrett and Tina Tchen held a meeting with a bipartisan group of 16 members of Congress to begin what will be "an ongoing dialog, for sure," according to a White House official."At the meeting, the White House reiterated the president and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's statements from earlier this week that sexual assault is a crime and will not be tolerated in the U.S. military," according to the official read-out. "Overall, the White House has made the health of the force a top priority, and will be working with the Department of Defense on results and accountability on efforts to eliminate sexual assault in the military. The group discussed various legislative proposals as well as actions that the Administration could take to hold offenders accountable, improve the reporting process, support victims, and work towards the prevention of sexual assault."There are three main legislative proposals on the table -- or about to be on the table -- about how to address the problem.* Democratic New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , who was at the White House meeting today, plans to formally introduce legislation next week. Her bill, which she's working in with Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, will take the most aggressive approach to reforming the system of adjudicating sexual assaults within the military. It's also likely to be the most controversial of the bunch, in that it proposes taking commanding officers out of the picture when it comes to the decision about whether to take serious assault cases to trial -- something Hagel has said he opposes -- replacing their judgment with that of experienced trial prosecutors. The bill would also codify a change Hagel already has proposed, amending the Uniform Code of Military Justice, according to a Gillibrand aide, "so that the convening authority may not (a) set aside a guilty finding or (b) change a finding of guilty to a lesser included offense."* New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Sen. Patty Murray of Washington on Tuesday introduced the Combating Military Sexual Assault (MSA) Act of 2013. This proposal would strengthen assault-prevention efforts, create Special Victims' Counsels to help survivors navigate the legal process, and automatically trigger referral of sexual-assault cases to the court-martial level or "next superior competent authority when there is a conflict of interest in the immediate chain of command." Rep. Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, plans to introduce a companion bill in the House.* Also in the House, Republican Mike Turner of Ohio and Democrat Niki Tsongas of Massachusetts, the chairs of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus, have introduced "the Better Enforcement for Sexual Assault Free Environments Act of 2013 (BE SAFE) Act." The act "requires that a person found guilty of an offense of rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, or an attempt to commit any of those offenses receive a punishment that includes, at a minimum, a dismissal or dishonorable discharge" and reforms the Uniform Code of Military Justice so that it's no longer possible to lessen sentences or set aside convictions of those convicted of serious sex crimes.New York City firefighters have reportedly been banned from hanging photos of President-elect Donald Trump in firehouses, on fire trucks and on the T-shirts they wear to work.
Mandelbrot set images may be created by sampling the complex numbers and testing, for each sample point c {\displaystyle c} , whether the sequence f c ( 0 ) , f c ( f c ( 0 ) ) , … {\displaystyle f_{c}(0),f_{c}(f_{c}(0)),\dotsc } goes to infinity (in practice -- whether it leaves some predetermined bounded neighborhood of 0 after a predetermined number of iterations). Treating the real and imaginary parts of c {\displaystyle c} as image coordinates on the complex plane, pixels may then be coloured according to how soon the sequence | f c ( 0 ) | , | f c ( f c ( 0 ) ) | , … {\displaystyle |f_{c}(0)|,|f_{c}(f_{c}(0))|,\dotsc } crosses an arbitrarily chosen threshold, with a special color (usually black) used for the values of c {\displaystyle c} for which the sequence has not crossed the threshold after the predetermined number of iterations (this is necessary to clearly distinguish the Mandelbrot set image from the image of its complement). If c {\displaystyle c} is held constant and the initial value of z {\displaystyle z} —denoted by z 0 {\displaystyle z_{0}} —is variable instead, one obtains the corresponding Julia set for each point c {\displaystyle c} in the parameter space of the simple function.
For each pixel (Px, Py) on the screen, do: { x0 = scaled x coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot X scale (-2.5, 1)) y0 = scaled y coordinate of pixel (scaled to lie in the Mandelbrot Y scale (-1, 1)) x = 0.0 y = 0.0 iteration = 0 max_iteration = 1000 // Here N=2^8 is chosen as a reasonable bailout radius. while ( x*x + y*y <= (1 << 16) AND iteration < max_iteration ) { xtemp = x*x - y*y + x0 y = 2*x*y + y0 x = xtemp iteration = iteration + 1 } // Used to avoid floating point issues with points inside the set. if ( iteration < max_iteration ) { // sqrt of inner term removed using log simplification rules. log_zn = log( x*x + y*y ) / 2 nu = log( log_zn / log(2) ) / log(2) // Rearranging the potential function. // Dividing log_zn by log(2) instead of log(N = 1<<8) // because we want the entire palette to range from the // center to radius 2, NOT our bailout radius. iteration = iteration + 1 - nu } color1 = palette[floor(iteration)] color2 = palette[floor(iteration) + 1] // iteration % 1 = fractional part of iteration. color = linear_interpolate(color1, color2, iteration % 1) plot(Px, Py, color) }
Beginning in 2020, the BCRA would make several significant revisions that affect the premium tax credits that people receive when they purchase nongroup coverage. First, the bill would revise income eligibility for premium tax credits, extending eligibility to people with incomes below poverty but capping eligibility at 350 percent of poverty. Second, the bill amends the way that premium tax credits are calculated so that the required income percentages vary with age and with income. Our estimates of the required income percentages under current law and the BCRA for 2020 are shown in the Appendix. The result is that on average people at younger ages would pay a lower share of their income to purchase a benchmark plan than they today while people at older ages would pay a higher share. Third, the bill reduces the value of the benchmark plans that are used to determine premium tax credits. The result is that a person who used their premium tax credit to purchase a benchmark plan would get a plan that on average would pay 58 percent of expected covered costs (a bronze plan), compared to 70 percent (a silver plan) under current law. A plan paying 58 percent of expected covered costs would have much higher cost sharing (e.g., deductibles) than a plan covering 70 percent of costs. This change is particularly important because the BCRA also would eliminate the cost sharing subsidies available under current law that reduce cost sharing and out-of-pocket limits for marketplace enrollees with incomes at or below 250 of poverty.
The vast majority of marketplace enrollees would pay higher premiums in 2020 for a silver plan. Older and lower income enrollees see the biggest increases. These results are driven by several provisions in the BCRA. First, the BCRA reduces the value of the benchmark plan used to calculate the premium tax credits (from a plan that, on average, pays 70 percent of expected costs to a plan that pays 58 percent of expected costs). Lowering the benchmark means that marketplace enrollees could enroll in what is roughly a bronze plan by paying their required income percentage, but that they would need to pay the entire difference in premium to enroll in the silver level plans that are most prevalent today. The second factor is the change in the required income percentages under the BCRA, which generally would reduce what younger adults would be required to pay but increases the amounts paid by older adults, particularly those at higher incomes. Among people with higher incomes, reducing the maximum income eligibility for premium tax credits from 400 percent of poverty to 350 percent of poverty increases costs for some marketplace enrollees, particularly people at higher ages who face relatively high premiums. Increasing the permitted premium variation due to age also would increase premiums for older adults not eligible for premium tax credits.
Because of the short time between the release of the discussion draft and the planned debate and vote in the Senate, we were unable to address all of the provisions that might affect premiums under the BCRA. Our analysis assumes that unsubsidized premiums for a 40-year-old would ultimately be the same under the ACA and BCRA. In the score released today (June 26), the Congressional Budget Office expects the difference in unsubsidized premiums for a 40-year-old between the ACA and BCRA to be quite small in 2026, which is consistent with our assumption; however, they expect BCRA premiums to be relatively lower in 2020, due in part to larger federal funding available in 2020 to reduce premiums. While these changes would have some impact on our results, the impact would be muted because we have focused on the amount that people pay after tax credits, and for most marketplace enrollees, those amounts are determined by their required income percentage and not the actual plan premium. For these people, the actual premium affects the amount of their tax credit, but not what they would pay for a benchmark plan. Generally lower premiums would affect our results primarily for those marketplace enrollees who would pay the full premium with no premium tax credit under the BCRA. These generally would be people with higher incomes or younger people facing very low premiums such that the full premium would be less than their required income percentage.
For each state’s on-marketplace and off-marketpace nongroup population, we drew purchasing units across five strata, each informed by federal data. For each state and the District of Columbia, we sampled subsidy-eligible marketplace enrollees both above and below 250% FPL, followed by a small group of ACA subsidy-eligibles forgoing help in the off-exchange market. Consistent with this administrative data, we also sampled a small group of wealthier nongroup enrollees (those not eligible for subsidies) into the Exchanges, and moved the remaining nongroup individuals into the off-exchange market. For non-immigrants with incomes below 100% of poverty, we calculate the amount of their required premium contribution as though their income were 138% of poverty. To most accurately reflect the age and income distribution of the Exchanges, each marketplace-purchasing unit received a sampling probability proportional to the average monthly subsidy per person within the state. At the conclusion of these ten repeated state sample draws, our average advanced premium tax credit (APTC) per month landed at $284 nationwide (compared to the $291 reported by HHS) and within $30 of the actual amounts displayed on table two of the HHS effectuated enrollment report for every geography except for the state of Connecticut. This close match of estimated APTC dollars for forty-nine states and the District of Columbia reflected a high degree of accuracy of the demographic (primarily age and income) distribution of our sampled exchange population.
To compare the effect of the Senate’s proposed Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) against current law under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), we attached both the second lowest cost silver and the lowest cost bronze plan premiums to each individual in each local market. These 2017 premiums from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Subsidy Calculator matched CPS respondents at the state and metropolitan area-level, with smaller areas not disclosed by the U.S. Census Bureau computed using a population-weighted average premium across the aggregation of non-metro areas. Matching our prior eligibility analyses, we computed ACA eligibility and subsidy receipt using the second lowest cost silver plan available to the HIU as the benchmark plan. To reflect the 58% Actuarial Value (AV) level stated by the BCRA, we used each geographic area’s lowest cost bronze plan as the benchmark plan for each HIU. In a small number of geographies without a bronze plan option for purchase on the 2017 exchanges, we used 85% of the silver plan as that local area’s benchmark plan premium. For each individual’s premium calculations under the BCRA, we relaxed the ACA’s 3:1 age rating to a 5:1 age band in all states that did not have community rating requirements in place prior to 2014. We followed CBO and HHS inflation factors to project all dollar values and thresholds to calendar year 2020. Using CBO’s economic projections, we inflated the 2015 income amounts in the 2016 CPS for each HIU to 2020 dollars. We increased premium dollars from 2017 to 2020 and both ACA and BCRA premium caps from 2014 to 2020 using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary projections. Our analysis assumes that states do not take up a waiver under the BCRA.The following passages are excerpts from Last Superman Standing: The Al Plastino Story, a forthcoming biography of the artist written by Ed Zeno.
We commissioned Dr. Steve Phillips to explore this space for us and identify giving opportunities. We had substantial discussion with Dr. Phillips around setting expectations appropriately – in particular, what to say about the likelihood of funding – which he found important in order to have conversations about possible projects. In this particular case, we did not commit any funds to malaria control and elimination projects, but we wouldn’t have been able to conduct this project if we hadn’t seen a legitimate possibility of doing so, and we’d be hesitant to dig further on these proposals (or to do a similar project in another area of global health) without having a relatively strong expectation of following up with funding. Labor mobility. We did a shallow investigation of the cause of labor mobility that included a conversation with Michael Clemens, a researcher on the global economics of migration who has been a leading voice on the humanitarian benefits of labor mobility.. However, it wasn’t until we communicated an intent to fund labor-mobility-related work that Dr. Clemens approached us with giving opportunities, including support of his own work as well as another project that we will be writing about in the future. We find the project both promising and unlikely to get funded without our involvement, and believe that we wouldn’t have been able to find out about it without specifically communicating an intent to provide funding. In addition, Dr. Clemens offered to introduce us to a person who might consider leaving their current post in order to pursue work in this area, but wouldn’t want this information widely disseminated.
Jamie Bradburn is a Toronto-based writer/researcher specializing in historical and contemporary civic matters.Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign event in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Credit:AP Clinton's numbers are firming as Trump implodes. But in recent time, close to 70 per cent of Americans have marked her down as dishonest. She can't make too much of Trump's worst-ever favourable ratings as a presidential candidate, because hers are the second worst. We get plenty of frightening professional analysis on why Trump behaves as he does – Clinton gets less time on the analyst's couch. Though in 1996, there was quite a kerfuffle when William Safire, self-styled "libertarian conservative" columnist and one-time supporter of Bill Clinton, denounced the then first lady in print as a "congenital liar" and an "habitual prevaricator" - to which her husband responded by saying that were he not the president, he'd have punched Safire on the nose. Despite being caught out repeatedly, Clinton is seen as consistently bending and breaking facts, whether it's about her past; about what she knew or didn't know about the 2012 Benghazi attack in which four Americans, including an ambassador, were killed; or about what she did or didn't do with the private email server stashed in her basement. Clinton was sensational in 2008, claiming to have landed in Bosnia as first lady "under sniper fire … with our heads down". No – the only welcome she received was from smiling schoolchildren waiting on the tarmac, eager to present Clinton with their poems.
In disagreeing, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler awarded Clinton four Pinocchios, which rated her claim that Comey had judged her to be truthful as "a whopper". And Americans balked at Comey's decision not to charge Clinton – almost 60 per cent wanted to see her in the dock. Asked in February if she had ever lied, Clinton replied with a lawyer's caution: "I don't believe I ever have. I don't believe I ever will." Robert Reich, US labour secretary under Bill Clinton, believes that Hillary Clinton has to break the habits of a lifetime to win a real mandate. Credit:Bloomberg But in damage-control mode upon being sprung, she has sometimes excused herself for having "misspoken" or, as in the case of her whopperish misrepresentation of the FBI director's words, that she "may have short-circuited". Inside Clinton, there's a lawyer that considers the meaning of individual words and of the gaps between them. So she often sounds long-winded, defensive and obtuse. When TV host Charlie Rose challenged her on Comey's charge that she was "careless", Clinton went into obfuscating overdrive: "Well, I would hope that you like many others would also look at what he said when he testified before Congress, because when he did, he clarified much of what he had said in his press conference."
It now seems likely that Clinton will win by default. There is no substantive campaign debate. Clinton conducts herself as the serious, qualified candidate, but the speeches that her campaign bills as "major" add little by way of substance or detail that might help voters to make an informed choice. Instead she plays whack-a-mole with Trump. The GOP candidate can hardly complain about the unrelenting media attention and analysis - he only ever got this far by manipulating the media. Happy to go under the radar if she can, Clinton doesn't complain either. There is a rising fear in the Democratic Party that Clinton could end up as a president without a mandate – and an echo of agreement from the Republican Party says Democrats are right to worry. Clinton administration labour secretary-turned-Bernie Sanders supporter Robert Reich warns that a relentless focus on Trump's temperament "doesn't give you a mandate to do anything". And on the Republican side, former Ted Cruz campaign aide Rick Tyler agrees: "Clinton is not likely to emerge with a legislative mandate – she'll have to start from zero in terms of selling all her policy proposals. They will not have been sold through this [election] process."
For Republicans with half a brain, a hassle-free dash to the White House for Clinton could be catastrophic – they obsess about the long-term implications of her likely opportunity to appoint as many as three liberal judges to the Supreme Court, and many in the GOP have yet to realise that in allowing a Democrat to scoop up young voters for the third election in a row - a first since the early 1950s - the political allegiance of America's biggest generation may be set for some time. Reich wonders if Clinton can break through the sentiment barrier with voters who like what she might do, but not who she is. Setting out decades of critiques and challenges to her and her husband – some deserved, others less so – Reich argues that for Clinton to give any ground brings fear of yet another attack, to the point of her refusing to hold press conferences or speak off the cuff. He sees that impulse as understandable but also self-defeating, as revealed by the level of public distrust in her. He offers a cure and a warning in the event that she does not take her meds: "It is critically important that she recognises this, that she fight her understandable impulse to keep potential attackers at bay, and that from here on she makes herself far more open and accessible – and clearly and fearlessly tells all."The treadmill doesn't work like the one at your gym, mind you. There aren't actually any moving parts. Instead, the user wears special, $60 super-slippery soled shoes adorned with accelerometers that track their movement as the user slide-steps atop the unit's floor. The user is also strapped into a lower body harness to keep them centered above the unit, which also allows them to shuffle their feet faster. All this physical movement translates into in game movement -- walk forward, to move forward in the game; back pedal to reverse course. Easy, right?
Two people are dead and two others are critically wounded after a domestic violence shooting unfolded in Salinas outside a federal office building.It happened at 8:45 a.m. Thursday outside the U.S. Social Security Administration office on the 900 block of Blanco Circle."This incident was purely domestic violence," Police Cmdr. Vince Maiorana said.VIDEO: 2 dead, two wounded in Salinas shootingMaiorana said an estranged husband and wife who live in Garden Grove, Calif. were having marital conflicts.The 32-year-old woman wanted to get away from her 50-year-old husband, so she drove to Salinas to stay with her aunt, uncle, and cousin, he said."The wife had come up to Salinas get away from martial difficulties they were having in Southern California," Maiorana said.The husband decided to follow and stalk his wife, police said. He found her Thursday morning outside the Social Security office while she was with her family.The husband argued with his wife until he pulled out a 9mm handgun and opened fire on everyone.The 51-year-old aunt and 64-year-old uncle died at the scene. The wife and her 28-year-old cousin were also shot and rushed to a trauma center in critical condition.Witness Mark Keszler told KSBW that the gunman showed very little emotion immediately after the shooting. "The scariest part of it was that he was so stoic. He just didn’t have any kind of emotion, anything in his face. That was really chilling. It was like watching a horror film," Keszler said.More than 10 people called 911. Officers surrounded and locked down the area. The suspected shooter was pointed out to officers by witnesses, and he was taken to the police station."(Witnesses) assisted us and directed us to the identity of the suspect. The cooperation we got from witnesses out at the scene was extraordinary," Maiorana said.Police declined to release the names of the victims and suspected shooter. He was still being questioned at the police station late Thursday afternoon."Our suspect completely confessed to what he did. We’re having a very candid conversation now on why he did what he did. We don’t know yet if there was premeditation, or if it was a spur of the moment thing," Maiorana said.Police do not believe the wife had a court-issued restraining order against her estranged husband. When asked what people who feel trapped in an physically abusive relationship should do, Maiorana answered, "If you’re in a domestic violence situation and you have a spouse who is stalking you, contact your local police department. Get a restraining order. You gotta make that step and do it."The suspected shooter will be booked into the Monterey County Jail on two counts of murder, police said.Police Chief Kelly McMillin thanked allied agencies that assisted in securing the crime scene Thursday, including, the FBI Safe Streets Task Force, Salinas Fire Department, California Highway Patrol, Monterey County Sheriff's Office, and Monterey County District Attorney's Office.While the examples of Common Core insanity have typically involved simple math, since they are the most blatant example, the mutation of standards as they apply to reading have been most insidious.
According to the indictment filed in the Central Military District Court, H.H. provided information around February 16-17 “that could harm state security.”The Israeli citizen middleman to whom H.H. allegedly provided the information, Sudi al-Makat, 48, from Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights, was indicted last week by the Nazareth District Court for a wide range of security offenses.H.H., Makat and associates were arrested by the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) and the police on and around February 25. According to investigators, Makat and other residents of Majdal Shams documented IDF movements along the border with Syria and transferred the information to officials in the Syrian government and intelligence community. Information was sent over the Internet, through a Syrian television station, and by a direct line that Makat had with Syrian officials.Makat admitted that he was in touch with Medhat Saleh, a Syrian government official well known for his links with officials in Syrian intelligence. Makat had served a full 27-year prison sentence up until 2012 for violent security crimes.The Central District Military Court ordered H.H. remanded to military police custody until the end of the trial and, until now, had imposed a gag order on the entire affair.On Thursday night, the High Court of Justice rejected a petition by Makat to appoint a defense lawyer for him who does not have approved credentials for representing defendants in cases dealing with classified information.Makat had argued that having a lawyer “approved” by the state, even if the state gave him some choice, was a policy made to muzzle defendants such as him.Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report.
The judge said the equalization amount takes into account a number of other debts, assets and personal property the couple had.PANAJI: The long line of patients waiting outside the grubby one-room clinic of a 'multispecialty doctor' in Sakhali, who claims to have cures for everything from diabetes to warts and chapped lips, is proof enough of the stranglehold of trust that quacks have on people in parts of the state.The 'homeopath' flaunts boxes of vaccine vials arranged on his desk, unworried about the cold chain storage that the immunizations require, or the fact that he has no business administering allopathic vaccines to his patients.Doctors in the state estimate that around 500 quacks practice allopathic medicine in Goa. "It's like fighting a losing battle, as these fraudsters are very well-connected," laments Dr Ulhas Karpe, member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).In 2008, Karpe was chairman of the Goa Medical Council 's Disciplinary and Ethics Committee when he launched a campaign to weed out the menace of quackery in the state. "We formed special committees to identify quacks practicing three different specialties-ophthalmology, pathology and radiology. After months of investigation, a detailed report was submitted, and then all hell broke loose," he recalls.Practitioners of the Indian systems of medicine took offense to the report that pulled up a few Ayurveda and Homeopathy practitioners for illegally practicing modern medicine, calling them 'cross-practice' quacks. Karpe was sacked from the post, and the council's report was forwarded to the union health ministry and forgotten about."In the meantime, the number of quacks-from hakims with no education at all, to qualified vaidyas with an affinity for prescribing allopathic medicines-has increased," claims Karpe. "Very often, the quacks are unintentionally bred by doctors, when they employ graduates and even school dropouts as 'helpers'," he adds. Many quacks he has come across were originally compounders or paramedics who have worked in Maharashtra and Karnataka, who after a few years' 'experience', moved to Goa to open their own 'clinics'.A senior surgeon, who recently spoke at a medical conference, also hinted at a 'nexus' between top corporate hospitals and quacks in Goa. "The problem of quackery is still prevalent because the medical fraternity itself shelters these people, who help their business by referring their 'untreatable' patients to corporate specialists," he said, pointing out that the patient is ultimately the scapegoat."The most common hazard of being investigated and treated by a quack is wrong diagnosis and wrong medication. The quacks prescribe steroids that initially show a miraculous benefit to the patient, without really treating the disease. Wrong doses of antibiotics, drug resistance and drug reactions are other dangerous consequences we have seen," Karpe says.Among the anti-quackery campaigners though, a feeling of helplessness has set in. "Every time we identify a quack and try to take up the issue, we receive a dozen calls from different politicians, asking us to back off. The Goa Medical Council has clear laws to penalize quacks, but no one seems interested in implementing them," says Dr Gladstone D'Costa, president of the IMA-Goa.Russia has denied as "absolute nonsense" claims by Kiev that Moscow has sent two contingents of its troops into war-ravaged eastern areas of Ukraine.
From the moment we arrived we were treated with dignity, respect, and kindness that was overly gracious and generous. I would like to specifically thank two angels on earth, our victim’s advocates, Sarah Graber and Autumn Shields. Without their guidance and love we would have never gotten through this period. Additionally, all of the team members led by Carole O’Shea were helpful and attentive. Steve and Nancy Travino from Ponderosa Valley Funeral Services were instrumental in helping guide us through the process so that we were able to have a very private and proper funeral for Alex. The hotel that we stayed in, Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Aurora Southlands, helped us with all of our needs and allowed us to take over their conference room for five days, as well as never letting the press know we were staying there. Somehow though, they did let all of the surrounding restaurants know that we were there and each one in turn sent us dinner without asking for anything in return. We are also in the debt of Alex’s favorite brewery, The Copper Kettle Brewing Company on Valencia St., Denver, Colorado. The owners Kristen Kozik and Jeremy Gobien were kind enough to open their doors on the following Tuesday for our immediate family and close friends so we could have a private repast after we held his funeral. They were so diligent that we were able to share stories and fond memories of Alex for hours in a semi-public setting without the press ever knowing we were there.

Picture by Swiss Metro Soon Switzerland could get holes like the famous Swiss cheese: If everything works out for the planners of the "Swissmetro", than by middle of this century the metropolitan areas Zürich, Bern, Lausanne, Geneva und St. Gallen should be connected through a Tunnel system, that is breathtaking in the true sense of the word. A maglev train without wheels should, similar to the already activated Transrapid in Shanghai release the aboveground commuter traffic in a low pressure-duct of 6 meters. The advantages of the idea are evident: Traffic jams, accidents, weather capers and a lot more force the traffic planers to perennially new extensions. Bigger tunnels have to be dug for the traffic, bridges are rebuilt or broadened. Speedier railway systems are run, which have to be protected by game fences and only save a few minutes time as well. All of that is becoming more and more costly through environmental regulations, mile long winding detours and abutter oppositions. A long-distance-subway would not only be environmentally sound compared to present traffic systems, it could also be dug dead straight, like an air-line distance of a plane in a depth of a 100 meters (under the groundwater table), because neither mountains nor difficult site would present an additional barrier. Swissmetro-Vice President Dr. Vincent Bourquin in the Interview: "Digging such a tunnel system over hundreds of kilometers is naturally not so cheap. But according to an international study the Swiss metro system is more beneficial over long distances than freeways and railway lines with all their constructional and legal problems."
Picture by Swiss Metro Once built, such a subway could not only snow-and ice-free outrank the traditional Swiss railway, but also rank before aircrafts with half of a sonic speed on short distances. Dr. Vincent Bourquin: "Our Vacuum-Metro and the aircraft are quite alike in many points: During normal air pressure in the tunnel sections our wheel-less Railway-Torpedo would be on the way with approximately 200 km/h. If one reduces the air pressure, lowers the air resistance, in such a way that a partial-vacuum is produced, the train can be much faster – with up to 600 km/h. Airplanes take advantage of the same trick by ascending into huge height, because the air pressure is lower there. There aircrafts fly speedier and save more fuel as well. Therefore the Swissmetro would be provided with the same over centuries proved pressurized cabins for passengers as an airplane." Austria is not as dense populated as Switzerland, but also here such an idea could be interesting, especially because in the alpine-area it is hard to make extensions, yet the area is protection-worthy. Already some years ago they started thinking about such a project, to unburden the Transit route on the Brenner to Italy. But it failed because of the little interest of investors. Now, the Swiss have the edge on here probably. (www.swissmetro.com).
Picture by Swiss Metro Vincent Bourquin: "Technically neither the tunnel nor the subway are a problem nowadays: Circa every 15 kilometers there would be a small station for the vacuum pumps, which provide the low pressure in the thermion system. The necessary preventive maintenances would be less, since the magnetic system is working contact-less in suspension. Austria has yet very excellent tunnel construction experts, who for example accomplish superior work in the course of the subway extension in Vienna now. Naturally we hope, Austrian engineers take part and share their know-how in building the Swissmetro, if we are ready for takeoff so far. Such a new project needs courage beside money. – Courage to rethink and a good deal of pioneering spirit. Nowadays that is not so easy to find anymore, as in times, as here in Switzerland the legendary Gotthard-Tunnel was dug." The inhabitants of Serfaus (Tirol) already showed courage and pioneering spirit on the mole's traces, when they decided to build a subway on air-bag basis through the place, in order to relief traffic during winter tourism. Many a mountain farmer then shook his head, and the cows in the barn didnt stand the drilling noise. Since then village roads that are blocked up by tourist-cars belong to the past finally. Over four stations the village-subway is able to transport 2000 persons per hour today. And at the beginning of the year, one already celebrated the 20-years jubilee of Austria's second subway system (after Vienna).
STEPHENSON: WELL, THE THING THAT WE HAVE SAID WAS PROBLEMATIC ALL ALONG WAS THE PROCESS THAT WAS USED TO PUT THESE RULES IN PLACE. AND THAT IT WAS DONE WITHOUT A FULL DATA GATHERING, WITHOUT A FULL REVIEW, AND SO WE THINK THAT BY ITSELF WILL PROBABLY BE CHALLENGED BY THE COURTS. SO JUST TO GO AT THIS FROM A MORE RATIONAL RULEMAKING STANDPOINT WOULD BE THE ONE THING WE COULD SEE REMANDED BACK, AND SO THERE HAD TO BE A FULL GATHERING OF DATA, A REVIEW OF THIS AND A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS. BUT THEN ONCE AGAIN, JUST THINKING ABOUT REGULATING THE INTERNET END TO END, AS KAYLA POINTED OUT A MOMENT AGO, AN INDUSTRY THAT IS CHANGING THIS FAST, THAT IS THIS DYNAMIC, I THINK JUST FROM A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT, OR FROM A NEW ADMINISTRATION STANDPOINT, ONE WOULD HAVE TO ASK, IS THIS REALLY HOW WE WANT TO REGULATE THIS INDUSTRY? KEEP IN MIND TITLE TWO WAS PUT IN PLACE WITH A 3-2 VOTE BY THE COMMISSION. TITLE TWO COULD BE CHANGED BY A 3-2 VOTE FROM ANOTHER COMMISSION. SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE THAT WE THINK IT'S REALLY UNLIKELY THESE RULES STAY IN PLACE LIKE THEY ARE IN THE LONG TERM.
Following his recent participation in the Subvert the city project last month UK based artist Eyesaw is once again working in the street. From what we can recall we last saw something from the artist in person back in 2012 when a number of subvertising artworks were installed on the street - the burger / King one on Hackney Road in London comes to mind.( We know we have a photo of this and will upload it once we find it!)Returning to London yesterday afternoon we spotted one of EYESAW's bus stop advert subversions on our way home. Dropping our bags off we headed back out with our camera to grab a picture of the new work from the artists. After a quick walk around the neighbourhood we discovered two additional works in this new series from Eyesaw. In all three of the works we founds the corporate logos and brand identities have been cut away from the original bus shelter advertising posters and juxtaposed with Eyesaw’s silhouette figures to produce what he calls 'images of ironic truth'.Using phenomenology, Eyesaw has said he aimsEYESAW on Instagram — @eyesawart Related Stories:Stephen Werther, the retail entrepreneur who is one of Mr. Bourdain’s partners in the venture, was more succinct: “People want Tony’s shows to come to life.”
Pier 57, a shipping terminal built in 1952 and vacant since 2003, is owned by the city and the state, which have leased it to Youngwoo & Associates, a real estate developer, and RXR Realty. The Bourdain market has a binding agreement with the two.: The Election Commission is yet to declare the dates when the Gujarat Assembly goes to polls, but the parties have already entered the yatra mode. Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi completed the first phase of his Navsarjan Gujarat Yatra earlier this week, and BJP president Amit Shah kicked off party's Gujarat Gaurav Yatra on Sunday.Shah started the campaign from Karamsad, the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It's not just about the Yatras anymore in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state. The BJP is countering Congress' "Vikas Gone Crazy" slogan with "I am Vikas, I am Gujarat", an attempt to connect state's development with its pride and identity.Flagging off the Gujarat Gaurav Yatra, BJP president Amit Shah told the gathering, "A lot of developmental work and people-oriented progress has been done by the Narendra Modi government in the past three years. It is the duty of our karyakartas to go and explain this to the people."Shah, then, took potshots at Rahul Gandhi, saying, "You are asking us to give an account of the progress made by us. What about the injustice that three generations have done to Gujarat."Also speaking on the occasion, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said: "For the Congress, development, and growth must be a matter of joke, but for the BJP, it is a matter of pride. A matter of Gujarati pride."Quite clearly, Rupani was referring to the onslaught of "Vikas Gone Crazy" memes on social media that have rattled the BJP leadership over the past one month or so.State BJP president Jitu Vaghani said that since 2002, the Congress had been trying to derail progress and development in Gujarat. "But the people of Gujarat have rejected the Congress over and over again, and these elections are not going to be any different," he said.Meanwhile, a group of Patidar youth tried to disrupt the speech of BJP President Amit Shah at Anand. They raised slogans - 'Jay Sardar Jay Patidar' - before the police stepped in and took them away. A fortnight ago, Patidars had protested against the Narmada Rath Yatra as well in various parts of Saurashtra and North Gujarat.Four such Gujarat Gaurav Yatras will begin from Central Gujarat, Saurashtra, North Gujarat and South Gujarat and culminate in Ahmedabad in a massive BJP rally that is likely to be addressed by Prime Minister Modi later in October.In a letter to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who has prioritised job growth in his latest strategy report, Italy said “the time has come to rethink strategy”, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
Surprising: Schedule III and IV drugs are rarely implicated in an arrest in Fairfax County. Only 2 arrests out of 1,738 involved a schedule III substance, and likewise, only 2 arrests involved a schedule IV substance. Well-known Schedule III substances include the drugs Ketamine, Buprenorphine, and opioid painkiller, Hydrocodone (Vicodin), in limited quantities. Schedule IV substances include anti-anxiety drugs Alprazolam (Xanax) and Clonazepam (Klonopin). Surprising: When it comes to distribution or possession with intent to distribute offenses, it surprised our Fairfax criminal lawyer that there were more schedule I and II drugs implicated than Cannabis. Note: the Code of Virginia uses the word, Marijuana, but the correct term (politically and scientifically), is Cannabis. Not Surprising: Possession of Cannabis (as a first time offense), was the most common drug charge. Arrests for Cannabis possession (first offense) occurred around three times more frequently than the next most charged drug offense, which was distribution or possession with intent to distribute a schedule I or II drug, not including Cannabis. Surprising: More people were arrested for an alleged assault on a family or household member than for assault on a non-family or household member. This is actually not surprising, but to a person who is not used to practicing criminal defense, it might be a shock. Surprising: More grand larceny offenses were the basis for arrest than petit larceny. We would have expected more larceny charges predicated upon a petit larceny allegation (less than $200, and not from a person), but grand larceny ($200 or more), very slightly edged petit larceny out by a few arrests. Surprising: There were a surprisingly large number of DWI charges against drivers alleged to have had a child in the car, as well as a BAC between .15 and .20. This offense was charged only slightly less frequently than refusal of a blood or breath test after DWI arrest, and also slightly less than the offense, “driving with a revoked license” (as a result of a DWI). Surprising: While it is not surprising that the charge, Drunk in Public – Profane Language, was the most frequently charged alcohol related offense, it was surprising that it so greatly dwarfed other alcohol offenses. 130 such arrests were made, compared to the next most frequently charged alcohol offense of possession of an open container, coming in at just 18 arrests in the same period. Not Surprising: While these next two offenses are very different, our Fairfax criminal defense attorney was not surprised that they were the basis of arrest at an equal rate: unintentional destruction of property valued at over $1,000 due to a vehicular accident (and where the driver left the scene), and intentional destruction of property (not involving a car accident). Somewhat surprising: Most people are aware of how serious a Virginia reckless driving charge is. Part of this public awareness is due to the frequency Virginia police charge drivers with this offense. It was somewhat surprising, however, that only 3 arrests were made for aggressive driving, compared to the 118 reckless driving charges in the given period. Somewhat surprising: 223 people were charged with driving without a valid license. This offense is known to be a frequent reason for arrest, but the volume of charges is somewhat surprising. It was the most frequently charged criminal offense by almost 100 arrests…making it the number one criminal offense committed by people in Fairfax County.
Apple is said to be "scrambling" to strike deals with movie studios in Hollywood regarding the exact prices of 4K movies in the iTunes Store, taking places just weeks ahead of the rumored debut of the new 4K Apple TV in mid-September While the talks have been ongoing for some time, discussions have been recently hampered by disagreements over the pricing of 4K movie purchases, according to sources close to the talks (via The Wall Street Journal ). Apple wants to charge $19.99 for 4K movie purchases in its digital iTunes Store, the same price it currently charges for newly-released HD films.However, many Hollywood studios it has talked with are pushing back on that price point and are looking to charge customers a premium for the new 4K content: $25 to $30 for a 4K movie in iTunes.Apple is said to be trying to finish these discussions well before September 12, the currently rumored date that will see the unveiling of the new 4K Apple TV, iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, Apple Watch Series 3, and more software-related announcements. As iTunes loses market share to companies like Amazon and Comcast, Apple is hoping that a revitalized Apple TV streaming box with 4K content -- which many rival devices have already supported -- will help boost iTunes sales into the last half of 2017 and the new year.In other Hollywood-related talks, earlier this month it was reported that multiple studios were pushing forward with a plan to offer digital movie rentals mere weeks after they appear in theaters. Studios like Universal Pictures and Warner Bros. were said to be in talks with partners, including Apple, to offer movies in iTunes as early as 17 days after their theatrical debut for about $50, or four to six weeks from release for $30.BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian state news agency on Friday attacked U.S. military plans to train and equip Syrian rebels, saying they amounted to support for terrorists.

In a note to investors obtained by AppleInsider, Kuo says the forthcoming iPhone will feature a 3D Touch module located beneath an OLED panel, a layered arrangement first introduced with iPhone 6s in 2015 Instead of using a sensor design involving flexible printed circuit boards, however, Apple is predicted to make the switch to thin film, a component package promising enhanced sensitivity over existing implementations. The increased should provide a better overall user experience than the now two-year-old 3D Touch design, perhaps paving the way for gestures more complex than home screen quick actions and system-wide " peek and pop " previews.Fitting a film sensor beneath an OLED panel is not easy, Kuo notes. Whereas current 3D Touch iterations integrate a rigid metal conductive plate as part of the layered sensor design, film sensor stacks do not, leaving the flexible OLED screen susceptible to deformation. To avoid potential damage from regular operation, a passive metal component will be placed under the film sensor to provide structural support, Kuo says.The new sensor materials and design inevitably require a more involved lamination process that will drive up per module costs, which the analyst estimates will increase 10 to 20 percent compared to current 3D Touch sensors. Module suppliers GIS and TPK are expected to split orders and begin shipping out supply in March or April.An evolution of Force Touch technology deployed in Apple Watch and MacBook trackpads, 3D Touch was originally billed as "the next generation of multi-touch" when it debuted on iPhone 6s.Unlike Force Touch, which uses sensors deployed under the perimeter of an Apple Watch display to detect finger pressure, 3D Touch employs an array of capacitive sensors integrated with an iPhone display's backlight. The system measures the distance between iPhone's flexible cover glass and the sensor array many times per second, then translates the results into granular force and location data.Film sensors operate under the same working principles, but offer more accurate deflection readings in a design that takes up much less internal space.Apple is widely rumored to unveil its first OLED iPhone later this year alongside a pair of "s" model upgrades for the iPhone 7 series. The 10th anniversary edition, as some are calling the OLED variant, is expected to feature a stainless steel " glass sandwich " design and incorporate exotic technologies like wireless charging, an "invisible" under-panel home button and more. Most recently, rumblings from within Apple's supply chain suggest the OLED version will sport a wraparound 5.8-inch OLED "flex" screen with embedded sensors.Currently, Mars has a thin atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide, with pressures at most of the planet's surface so low that liquid water will immediately boil. But a variety of features we've discovered argue that the planet has once supported copious amounts of water, indicating that the planet's atmosphere must have differed considerably in the past. Using radar data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have now found a potential resting place for some material that was once in the Martian atmosphere: a huge deposit at the south pole that holds nearly as much CO 2 as the planet's current atmosphere.
It shows only inflation-adjusted, pre-tax pay packets, so it excludes the impact of inflation, company benefits, or taxes and government benefits, such as food-stamps and tax-breaks for children, or of Obamacare’s subsidies and spending obligations. It shows median income, which is the midpoint of the income scale. Half the people earn above the line, half the people earn below the line. Average income would be higher, but less revealing, because a higher share of income is going to the highest earners, compared to back in the 1970s. The chart shows the income of year-round, full-time workers, excluding part-workers or seasonal workers, or those who work on-and-off under contracts. The chart does not make distinctions by race. The chart shows individuals’ income, not the income of households, which has fluctuated as the average number of children or adults has declined. The chart only shows income, but not the quality of goods in the stores, such as Starbucks coffee, cheap products imported from China, high-tech music players, improved autos or better health-care. That rise in product quality from competing companies — not claimed policy improvements from federal agencies — has provided the vast majority of material gains for Americans amid flat incomes.
Still, there is much for him to gain in the three scheduled televised showdowns and he will get an unfiltered chance to raise Clinton’s political vulnerabilities before the American people. sourceAt the start of the first world war, razor-sharp Marxist organizer Rosa Luxemburg described the world around her as existing within a turning point: it would be socialism or barbarism. She wrote, “either the triumph of imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome, depopulation, desolation, degeneration––a great cemetery. Or the victory of socialism, that means the conscious active struggle of the international proletariat against imperialism and its method of war. ” (Junius Pamphlet, Ch. 1). This image of socialism or barbarism has been evoked many times throughout history in moments of historical crisis; each time the struggle for liberation has fallen short. Shortly after writing this pamphlet, Luxemburg’s own Party betrayed her by siding with the imperialists in the Great War, and later had her murdered. Barbarism has continued to reign through cycles of working class and oppressed-led movements, full on insurrections, experiments and attempts to build something within the shell of the old. Barbarism has thrived and built upon its power tenfold, most sharply expressed last month in Charlottesville.
The Handmaid's Tale is the most populist dystopian story today, lifting off from Margaret Atwood’s original depiction, and expressed through a contemporary lens. The series reflects what coalesced into the Million+ Women’s March on Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration, followed by the International Women’s Strike on March 8th. There is simply a large constituency of liberal to radical women who are increasingly concerned about Trump’s rape history and rhetoric, the increasing lack of control over women’s bodies and reproduction, and the alt-right’s blatant anti-woman position. A majority of these women are content to demonstrate peacefully, make individualistic and/or consumer-based interventions and go home. Critiques from the left have contented that this is a contemporary expression of “white feminism” that fails to grasp what is necessary for liberation, precisely because of the privileged white woman’s lived experience. The Women’s March white feminists represent the passive acceptance of the world portrayed in The Handmaid’s Tale. Offred, the main character, is defined by motherhood and coerced access to her sexuality, despite attempts to break out of this one-sidedness. Over and over again, she submits the world around her (nevermind how the world got there in the first place, something that appears to have creeped upon her unknowingly), shying away from insurrections, subversion and escape attempts when faced with violent consequences. Each time she strikes out, she is equally struck down and withdraws. Similar to many of the women who marched on Washington, Offred seeks to find a less painful path to liberation. Furthermore, some have argued that the narrative has particular racial contours––that white women are for the first time experiencing, or imagining, horrors that have always existed for Black and Brown women––calling the series a “white woman’s dystopia.”
In a later community meeting, one Black woman criticized us very angrily for ever thinking we could achieve our goals by working only with white women. We said we never meant this few weeks of this particular kind of work to be all we ever did and told her we had decided at the beginning to organize a group open to all women shortly after our series of white women’s meetings came to a close. Well, as some of you will know without my telling, we could hardly have said anything less satisfying to our critic. She exploded with rage: “You decided!” Yes. We consulted the opinions of some women of color, but still, we decided. “Isn’t that what we are supposed to do?” we said to ourselves, “Take responsibility, decide what to do, and do something?” She seemed to be enraged by our making decisions, by our acting, by our doing anything. It seemed like doing nothing would be racist and whatever we did would be racist just because we did it. We began to lose hope; we felt bewildered and trapped. It seemed that what our critic was saying must be right; but what she was saying didn’t seem to make any sense.
I was at a poetry reading by the Black lesbian feminist, Audre Lorde. In her poems she invoked African goddesses, naming several of them. After the reading a white woman rose to speak. She said first that she was very ignorant of African religious and cultural history, and then she asked the poet to spell the names of these goddesses and to tell her where she might look for their stories. The poet replied by telling her that there is a bibliography in the back of the book from which she was reading which would provide the relevant information. The white woman did not thank the poet and sit down. The white woman (who I know is literate) said, “I see, but will you spell their names for me?” What I saw was a white woman committed to her ignorance and being stubborn in its defense. She would convince herself that she cannot use this bibliography if the Black woman will not spell the names for her. She will say she tried to repair her ignorance but the poet would not cooperate. The poet. The Black woman poet who troubled herself to include a bibliography in her book of poems. ****
There is an enlightening account of some structures of white ignorance also in a story called “Meditations on History,” by Sherley Ann Williams.4 In the story, a man who is writing a book about how to manage slaves is visiting a place where a slave woman is being held until her baby is born so that, when they hang her for running away and killing a white man, her owner will at least have the baby to make up for his loss. The writer is interviewing the woman to find out why she killed the slave trader, and why and how the slaves got loose. (His ignorance is, of course, already showing, along with some of the structures which both motivate and support it.) He is irritated by her humming and singing, but it never occurs to him that it means anything. By way of her songs, the woman is able to conspire with the other slaves around the place; she tells them that her friends will come to rescue her and notifies them when the time is at hand; they cooperate with her, and she escapes. The hapless interviewer is totally baffled by her escape. His presumptions have closed out knowledge; his ignorance has been self-constructed. His ignorance has also been both encouraged and used by the slave woman, who has deliberately and reasonably played on it by pretending to be stupid, robotic and disoriented. It was certainly not in her interest to disabuse him of his assumptions that her singing was mindless and that she was too mindless to be plotting an escape. Ignorance works like this, creating the conditions which ensure its continuance.
If one wonders at the mechanisms of ignorance, at how a person can be right there and see and hear, and yet not know, one of the answers lies with the matter of attention. The man in Williams’ story constantly daydreams about what a great success his book is going to be; he has compelling fantasies of his own fame and recognition–recognition by white men, of course. He is much more intent upon the matter of whom he will please and impress than he is upon the matter at hand. Members of dominant groups are habitually busy with impressing each other and care more for that than for actually knowing what is going on. And again, white women can learn from our own experience a propos (most often, white) men. We do much of what we do with a great anxiety for how we will be received by men–by mentors, friends, husbands, lovers, editors, members of our disciplines, professions or political groups, tenure-review committees, fathers. With our attention focused on these men, or our imaginings of them, we cannot pay attention to the matter at hand and will wind up ignorant of things which were perfectly apparent. Thus, without any specific effort these men can turn white women to the work of falsification even as we try to educate ourselves. Since white women are almost white men, being white, at least, and sometimes more-or-less honorary men, we can cling to a hope of true membership in the dominant and powerful group, and if our focus is thus locked on them by this futile hope, we can be stuck in our ignorance and theirs all our lives. (Some men of color fall into the parallel trap of hoping for membership in the dominant and powerful group, this time because of their sex. With their attention focused on power and money, they cannot see women, of their race or any other.) Attention has everything to do with knowledge.
Simply as females, as mere women in this world, we who are female and white stand to be poor, ill-educated, preyed upon and despised. But because we are both female and white, we belong to that group of women from which the men of the racially dominant group choose their mates. Because of that we are given some access to the benefits they have as members of the racially dominant male group–access to material and educational benefits and the specious benefits of enjoying secondhand feelings of superiority and supremacy. We also have the specious benefit of a certain hope (a false hope, as it turns out) which women of subordinated races do not have, namely the hope of becoming actually dominant with the white men, as their “equals.” This last pseudo-benefit binds us most closely to them in racial solidarity. A liberal white feminism would seek “equality”; we can hardly expect to be heard as saying we want social and economic status equal to that of, say, Chicanos. If what we want is equality with our white brothers, then what we want is, among other things, our own firsthand participation in racial dominance rather than the secondhand ersatz dominance we get as the dominant group’s women. No wonder such feminism has no credibility with women of color.
* Amusingly, in my attempts over the last 10 years to convince myself that no space-efficient kitchen needs such a silly machine, I’ve amassed a cluttered drawer of citrus hopefuls. There have been two reamers, one metal and one wooden, a lever-handled old-fashioned looking thing that turned out to be pretty but absolutely useless, a Kitchen Aid attachment that sprayed my clothes and left juice running from wrist to elbow, but less so in the measuring cup and one of these, which is actually pretty awesome but painful if you’re going for a pitcher of lemonade. In the end, I bought not one but two electric citrus juicers. The first one is the one I’d recommend anyone else buy — it’s inexpensive and has a ton of raving reviews on Amazon (this is an updated link). I only ended up returning it because I really wanted one like my grandmother used to have, with a spout that I could place a glass underneath. I’m quite happy with the one I ended up with but should warn that it doesn’t strain the pulp especially well. For that, you should set a small strainer over your glass as before you start squeezin’.
House Of Cards(NaturalNews) The mainstream media have been tireless in their recent efforts to discredit and demonize those who dare question the safety or efficacy of vaccines, and particularly those who choose not to have their children vaccinated.What seems obvious now is that an honest dialogue on the subject seems nearly impossible in a climate of fear-mongering created by those who control the flow of information to the masses.The reports recently being circulated by the major media outlets are designed to lead people to believe that the entire anti-vaccine movement has grown out of response to a single (and allegedly spurious, according to the pro-vaccine camp) study linking mercury-containing vaccines with incidences of autism.Although there may be room for debate on that particular aspect of the subject at hand, what the media is not mentioning is that there are far more reasons to be skeptical about vaccines in general.The typical news story seen lately tends to label "anti-vaxxers" as the worst type of conspiracy nuts -- a small group of tin-foil-hat-wearing wackos who threaten their children's lives and the rest of the populace with their paranoid delusions. Many news reports have advocated imprisonment for parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.At the same time, vaccines are being promoted as completely safe and effective -- an assertion which is simply not true. There are mounds of evidence from dozens of studies indicating that many vaccines are neither efficacious nor harmless.A glaring example is the extremely compelling evidence that Merck & Co., one of the largest vaccine manufacturers on the planet, has provided false statements and faked clinical trials in connection with their mumps vaccine This fraud and deception on the part of Merck has been occurring for at least the past decade, and might still be occurring if it weren't for the actions of two whistleblowers from the company's laboratories who initially filed a lawsuit in 2012 -- a lawsuit which, despite Merck's efforts to have it dismissed, has recently ballooned into a federal case:The company now faces federal fraud charges. The whistleblowers' court documents state that Merck:"...failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented, (ii) used improper testing techniques, (iii) manipulated testing methodology, (iv) abandoned undesirable test results, (v) falsified test data, (vi) failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine , (vii) falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling, (viii) falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA, (ix) falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract, (x) engaged in the fraud and concealment describe herein for the purpose of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for mumps vaccine, (xi) mislabeled, misbranded, and falsely certified its mumps vaccine, and (xii) engaged in the other acts described herein to conceal the diminished efficacy of the vaccine the government was purchasing."The fact that Merck, with hundreds of millions of dollars at its disposal to hire a high-powered legal team, was not able to have the lawsuit dismissed, is damning evidence that there is substance in the allegations.The court upheld all of the original complaints made by the whistle-blowers, and under the False Claims Act, Merck could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars (possible even billions) in damages.For more than three decades, Merck has had an exclusive license granted by the FDA to manufacture and sell its Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine to the public. To retain its licensing rights, Merck was required to prove that its updated vaccine formula had at least a 95 percent efficacy rate.This is the reason Merck falsified data -- the company knew that the vaccine was not nearly as effective as it was required to be, and out of greed and callousness, deliberately lied to the FDA and the American public with an utter disregard for the health consequences.Personally, I would expect this to be a bigger scandal and one of far greater concern than the minority of parents who refuse to have their children vaccinated, but there has been barely a whisper in the mainstream press regarding this pending lawsuit.It also would seem to exonerate those who question the safety and efficacy of vaccines in general, but the media is now engaged in a vicious smear campaign against the anti-vaxxers.And if you're wondering how this could possible happen, the answer -- as usual -- is "follow the money."The mainstream media is owned by its advertisers and is also heavily influenced by those in the government who have been bought by lobbyists. And guess what? Big Pharma is one of the biggest lobby groups out there.So, if you find yourself tempted to jump on the bandwagon, along with those in the media and elsewhere who are bent on vilifying those who question the safety and reliability of vaccines, maybe you should first consider taking a step back to closely examine their motives.The second half, devoted to the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia in 1967 that ended in Guevara’s death, is equally rigorous in its depiction of a failed revolt. Though Guevara tried, in a new context, to apply the strategic lessons of the Cuban revolution — concentrate on the countryside; cultivate popular support; maintain discipline and cohesion in the ranks — everything went wrong. And it turned out that Guevara’s adversaries, the Bolivian army and its American advisers, had learned a thing or two about how to wage an effective counterinsurgency.
The Soviet Union nationalised industry and established a foreign-trade monopoly to allow the productive co-ordination of the national economy and so prevent Russian national industries from competing against each other. To feed the populaces of town and country, Lenin instituted War Communism (1918–1921) as a necessary condition—adequate supplies of food and weapons—for fighting the Russian Civil War (1917–1923).[15] Later in March 1921, he established the New Economic Policy (NEP, 1921–1929), which allowed measures of private commerce, internal free trade and replaced grain requisitions with an agricultural tax under the management of state banks. The purpose of the NEP was to resolve food-shortage riots among the peasantry and allowed measures of private enterprise, wherein the profit motive encouraged the peasants to harvest the crops required to feed the people of town and country; and to economically re-establish the urban working class, who had lost many men (workers) to the counter-revolutionary Civil War.[19][20] With the NEP, the socialist nationalisation of the economy could then be developed to industrialise Russia, strengthen the working class and raise standards of living, thus the NEP would advance socialism against capitalism. Lenin regarded the appearance of new socialist states in the developed countries as necessary to the strengthening Russia's economy and the eventual development of socialism. In that, he was encouraged by the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Italian insurrection and general strikes of 1920 and industrial unrest in Britain, France and the United States.
For the purpose of evaluating trends in the total number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions, annual statistics are reported for 1998--2007, and in each case the percentage change from 1998 to 2007 and from 2006 to 2007 has been calculated. Only the 45 reporting areas that provided data every year during the entire period were included. Similarly, annual statistics are presented for 1998--2007 for certain variables (abortions by maternal age, gestational age, race, and ethnicity), with reporting areas included only if they provided data that met reporting standards every year. For other variables (marital status, number of previous abortions, and number of previous births), data are reported only for 1998, 2006, and 2007, and reporting areas are included if they reported all 3 years. To evaluate trends in the use of different abortion procedures, reporting areas were included only if they provided complete data and specifically included medical abortion as a method on their reporting form. Approval of mifepristone for medical abortion was granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2000 (33); 2001 was the first complete year during which early medical abortion was available in the United States. Therefore, comparisons have been made between 2001 and 2007 and between 2006 and 2007.
Since 1987, CDC has monitored abortion-related deaths through its Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS) (36). Additional sources of data for abortion-related deaths include state vital records, public health agencies, maternal mortality review committees, health-care providers, private citizens and citizen groups, and media reports, including computerized searches of full-text newspaper and other print media databases. For each death that possibly is related to abortion, CDC requests clinical records and autopsy reports. Two clinical epidemiologists review these reports to determine the cause of death and whether the death was abortion related. Each abortion-related death then is categorized by abortion type as legal induced, illegal induced, spontaneous, or unknown type. This report provides data on abortion-related deaths that occurred during 1972--2006; data for 2006 have not been published previously and are the most recent data available. Possible abortion-related deaths that occurred during 2007--2010 are under investigation. Although national case-fatality rates (the number of abortion-related deaths per 100,000 reported legal induced abortions) have been published for 1972--1997, this measure could not be calculated for 1998--2006 with CDC data because a substantial number of abortions have been documented in states that did not report to CDC (3,37), and thus the total number of abortions was not available as the rate denominator.
Total abortion numbers, rates, and ratios have been calculated by individual reporting area of occurrence and the residence status of the women who obtained the procedures (Table 2). By reporting area of occurrence, a considerable range existed in the total number of reported abortions, ranging from nine (Wyoming) to 91,954 (Florida); in the abortion rate, ranging from 4.6 (South Dakota) to 48.3 (New York City) abortions per 1,000 women§§§; and in the abortion ratio, ranging from 58 (Idaho and South Dakota) to 737 (New York City) abortions per 1,000 live births.¶¶¶ Similarly, a considerable range existed by residence status**** in the total number of reported abortions, ranging from 833 (South Dakota) to 83,326 (New York City); in the abortion rate, ranging from 5.4 (South Dakota) to 44.3 (New York City) abortions per 1,000 women; and in the abortion ratio, ranging from 67 (Utah) to 676 (New York City) abortions per 1,000 live births. Given the substantial variation that also occurred among reporting areas in the percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents, ranging from none (Alaska) to 53.5% (District of Columbia), abortion rates and ratios calculated by residence status might provide a more accurate reflection of population trends. However, these measures must be viewed with caution because of the variation across reporting areas in methods used to record residence status and the resulting 12.6% of abortions reported without a state, territory, reporting area, or country of residence.
Among the 48 areas that reported by age for 2007, women aged 20--29 years accounted for the majority (56.9%) of abortions and had the highest abortion rates (29.4 and 21.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 20--24 and 25--29 years, respectively) (Figure 2; Table 3). Women in the youngest and oldest age groups (<15 or ≥40 years) accounted for the smallest percentage of abortions (0.5% and 3.2%, respectively) and had the lowest abortion rates (1.2 and 2.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged <15 and ≥40 years, respectively). Among the 44 reporting areas that provided data every year during 1998--2007, this pattern across age groups was stable, with the majority of abortions and the highest abortion rates occurring among women in their 20s and the lowest percentage of abortions and abortion rates occurring among women in the youngest and oldest age groups (Table 4). However, during 1998--2007, the abortion rate and percentage of abortions accounted for by women in the youngest age groups decreased, and the abortion rate and percentage of abortions accounted for by older women increased. From 2006 to 2007, abortion rates decreased among women aged 15--39 years; however, given the increase that occurred during 2005--2006, abortion rates still were higher in 2007 than they had been in 2005 for all women in this age range, except for adolescents aged 15--19 years, among whom a 1% decrease occurred.
Among the 46 areas that reported age by individual year among adolescents for 2007, adolescents aged ≤19 years accounted for 115,209 abortions (Table 5). The adolescent abortion rate was 10.7 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged ≤19 years, and the adolescent abortion ratio was 337 abortions per 1,000 live births. Adolescents aged 18--19 years accounted for the majority (62.3%) of adolescent abortions and had the highest adolescent abortion rates (21.2 and 25.8 abortions per 1,000 adolescents aged 18 and 19 years, respectively). Adolescents aged <15 years accounted for the smallest percentage of adolescent abortions (3.1%) and had the lowest adolescent abortion rate (1.2 abortions per 1,000 adolescents). Among the 41 reporting areas that provided data every year during 1998--2007, this pattern across age groups was stable, with older adolescents accounting for a larger percentage of adolescent abortions and having higher abortion rates (Table 6); nonetheless, differences across adolescent age groups were larger in 2007 than in 1998. For abortion rates, a decrease occurred among all adolescents aged >15 years during 2006--2007. However, although 2007 abortion rates decreased below 2005 rates for adolescents aged 15--17 years, because of the increase among adolescents aged 18--19 years that had occurred during 2005--2006, the 2007 abortion rates among these older adolescents were essentially unchanged from 2005.
Among the 38 areas that reported by procedure type and included medical abortion on the reporting form distributed to medical providers for 2007, 78.1% of abortions were performed by curettage at ≤13 weeks' gestation, and 13.1% were performed by early medical (nonsurgical) abortion; 7.9% were performed by curettage at >13 weeks' gestation, and all other procedures were uncommon (Table 11). Among the 28 reporting areas that included medical abortion on their reporting form and provided this data for all 3 years of comparison (2001, the first full year following FDA approval of mifepristone for use in early medical abortion, as well as 2006 and 2007),†††† the use of early medical abortion increased 12% from 2006 and 243% from 2001 (from 3.5% of abortions in 2001 to 10.7% in 2006 and 12.0% in 2007). In contrast, the use of curettage at ≤13 weeks' gestation decreased 1% from 2006 and 9% from 2001 (from 87.2% of abortions in 2001 to 80.2% in 2006 and 79.0% in 2007). The use of curettage at >13 weeks' gestation remained essentially unchanged (accounting for 8.5% of abortions in 2001 and 8.3% in 2006 and 2007). All other methods accounted for a consistently small percentage of abortions (0.1%--0.7%).
Among women from the 37 areas that reported race for 2007, white women (including Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women) accounted for the largest percentage (55.9%) of abortions; black women accounted for 36.5% and women of other racial groups for 7.6% of abortions (Table 12). Black women had higher abortion rates and ratios than white women and women of other races (Table 12). Among the 27 reporting areas that provided data every year during 1998--2007, the percentage distribution of abortions by race changed little; although abortions among women in the other racial category increased, the percentage remained low (Table 13). Abortion rates decreased during 2006--2007 among women from all racial groups, continuing the long-term decrease during 1998--2007 that had been interrupted by a 1-year increase during 2005--2006. However, because the increase in abortion rates during 2005--2006 had been much greater for white women (4%) than for black women (1%), the abortion rate was 2% higher for white women in 2007 than it had been in 2005 but 1% lower than it had been for black women. Abortion ratios also decreased during 2006--2007 among women from all racial groups, with a larger cumulative decrease during 2005--2007 among black women (7%) compared with white women (2%) (Table 13).
For 2007, a total of 827,609 abortions were reported in the United States. Among the 45 reporting areas that provided data for every year during 1998--2007, a total of 810,582 abortions were reported for 2007. These same 45 areas reported an abortion rate of 16.0 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15--44 years and an abortion ratio of 231 abortions per 1,000 live births. Compared with 2006, this represents a 2% decrease in the total number and rate of reported abortions and a 3% decrease in the abortion ratio. Thus, the decrease that occurred during 2006--2007 is consistent with the general decrease that occurred during 1998--2007. However, the changes that occurred during 2006--2007 contrast with the pattern observed during 2005--2006, when a 3% increase in the total number and rate of reported abortions paralleled a 3% increase in both the total number of live births and the fertility rate (live births per 1,000 women aged 15--44 years) for the United States (12,39). Because birth data for 2008 and preliminary numbers for 2009 show a decrease in the total number of births and the fertility rate for the United States (40,41), subsequent years of abortion data, when available, will be important for evaluating trends in pregnancy outcomes.
The shift in abortion to earlier stages of gestation, although not observed equally among all women, has been facilitated by changes in the types of procedures being used. Curettage has remained the most common method for performing abortions. Although for many years this type of abortion had been performed only after the initial weeks of gestation, the development of highly sensitive pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasonography increasingly have allowed clinicians to diagnose pregnancy and confirm its termination at ≤6 weeks' gestation (52--57). In addition, the increasing use of medical abortion has contributed to the increasing percentage of abortions performed early in gestation. In September 2000, FDA approved mifepristone for use in early medical abortion (33), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has endorsed an evidence-based protocol that can be used up to 63 days of gestation (18). In 2007, 63.3% of abortions were performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation and thus were eligible for early medical abortion; 20.3% of these eligible abortions and 13.1% of all abortions were reported as early medical abortions. The use of early medical abortion also has increased substantially since FDA approved the use of mifepristone: during 2001--2007 the percentage of all reported abortions accounted for by this method increased 243%. Moreover, whereas the rate of increase leveled off after the initial years of approval (58), the proportional use of this method continues to increase, with the percentage of all abortions reported as early medical abortion increasing 12% during 2006--2007.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because reporting requirements are established by the individual reporting areas (15), the collection of data varies, and CDC is unable to obtain the total number of abortions performed in the United States. During 1998--2007, the total annual number of abortions recorded by CDC was only 65%--69% of the number recorded by the Guttmacher Institute (37), which uses numerous active follow-up techniques to increase the completeness of the data obtained through its periodic national survey of abortion providers (11). Although most reporting areas collect and send abortion data to CDC, this information is given to CDC voluntarily; consequently, during 1998--2007, 45 of the 52 reporting areas provided CDC data on a consistent annual basis, and CDC did not obtain any information from California, Maryland, or New Hampshire for 2007.††††† In addition, whereas most of the reporting areas that send abortion data to CDC have laws requiring medical providers to submit a report for every abortion they perform to a central health agency, in New Jersey and the District of Columbia, medical providers submit this information voluntarily (14). As a result, the abortion numbers these areas report to CDC tend to be relatively incomplete.§§§§§ Moreover, even in states that legally require medical providers to submit a report for all the abortions they perform, enforcement of this requirement varies (59), and thus several other reporting areas provide CDC with comparatively incomplete numbers.¶¶¶¶¶
Second, because reporting requirements are established by the individual reporting areas, CDC's model reporting form (16) is not consistently used to request information from abortion providers. Consequently, many reporting areas do not collect all the information CDC requests on the characteristics of women obtaining abortions (e.g., age, race, and ethnicity) (59); similarly, some reporting areas do not specifically include medical abortion as one of the potential methods for terminating a pregnancy (14). Although missing demographic information might reduce the extent to which the statistics in this report represent all women in the United States, three nationally representative surveys of women obtaining abortions in 1987, 1994--1995, and 2001--2002 have produced distributions of characteristics similar to the distributions reported by CDC for the relevant years (7--9). However, compared with estimates for demographic variables, CDC's early estimates for the use of medical abortion might not as accurately represent the proportional contribution of this method because these estimates were based on comparatively incomplete data. In 2001, the first full year following FDA approval of mifepristone for early medical abortion, only 28 reporting areas specifically requested information on the use of this method from abortion providers. As more states add medical abortion to their reporting forms, CDC estimates of the proportional contribution of this method should improve; however, trend analyses will continue to be affected by early data.
According to the most recent national estimates, nearly one fifth of all pregnancies in the United States end in abortion (5). Multiple factors can influence the incidence of abortion, including the availability of abortion providers (11,68--70); the adoption of state regulations, such as mandatory waiting periods and parental involvement laws (49,71); increasing acceptance of nonmarital childbearing (72,73); shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S. population (74,75); and changes in the economy and the resulting impact on fertility preferences and access to health-cares services, including contraception (76,77). However, even with these influences, most abortions are preceded by an unintended pregnancy, with intended pregnancies estimated to account for 4% of all abortions (21), including those which presumably are performed for maternal medical indications and fetal abnormalities. Providing women with the knowledge and resources necessary to make decisions about their sexual behavior and use of contraception can help them avoid unintended pregnancies and thus reduce the number of women seeking abortion. However, efforts to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in the United States have been challenging. Findings from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), the primary national source of data on unintended pregnancy in the United States, suggest that unintended pregnancy rates decreased during 1982--1995 in conjunction with an increase in the proportion of women at risk for unintended pregnancy****** who were using contraception (79--81). However, by 2002, contraceptive use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy had decreased (80), and decreases in unintended pregnancy had plateaued (21). Data from the 2006--2008 NSFG indicate that contraceptive use among women at risk for unintended pregnancy has not increased subsequently, and only small increases have occurred in the use of the most effective forms of reversible contraception (78). Previous research has shown that the total number of unintended pregnancies and abortions is similar for the comparatively small group of women at risk for unintended pregnancy who are not using any form of contraception and for the much larger group of women who are not using contraception effectively (21,82,83). Therefore, improvements in use of family planning for both of these groups are needed to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, and thus the number of abortions that are performed, in the United States.

I start off with Gratitudes. This is the space where I think about all of the amazing things in my life that I am grateful for. My family, my business, my friends, my health, the feeling of the cool air on my skin as it rushes into the room when the instructor opens the door for a second during hot yoga class, whatever! Gratitudes are anything that you feel especially thankful for this morning. Sometimes, we wake up feeling sad, and I’ll be the first to admit, it’s a hard feeling to break. However, rather than focusing on the bad, I encourage you to sit your butt down and write out all of the good! Seeing it on paper really helps to understand how blessed you are. And remember, what you put out into the world is what you get back. Have you heard of the Law of Attraction? I’ve found this time and time again to ring true, so I know that if I want to be HAPPY, feel LOVED, and live the life of my DREAMS, then I better be talking about all of the great things in my life, putting my gratitude out there in the world so more of that delicious goodness comes into my world!
The final section is Guide. This section gives me goosies when I think about it. It is the space where you write in the present tense on the day you have reached your goals. Describe the day in full details; what are you wearing, who are you with, what is scheduled for the day? Soak it all in and think about how incredible that day will be. My guide might sound like this: It’s my 24th birthday, November 12th, and I’m waking up in one of my favorite cities, Chicago. Ryan and I are here for a week-long celebration, and I smile and laugh with so much love and gratitude because I have hit a six-figure annual income. We have breakfast in bed, then spend the day walking and playing in the light snow, stopping for lunch at our favorite deep-dish pizza place (Lou Malnati’s), and seeing an afternoon movie. We go out for drinks and leave our cell phones in the hotel, completely in love with the present moment. When we get home, we pack up all of our things, swapping out our cold weather gear for bikinis and board shorts, because tomorrow, we leave for a vacation in Bali.
Print This Email This Group tells Raw it will reach out to both parties Freedom's Watch, a pro-Iraq war interest group populated by prominent Republicans and former Bush administration officials, swept into the debate over the war this summer with a series of slickly produced, emotional TV ads. Now the group wants to take its arguments straight to the Capitol Hill lawmakers who are debating how and whether to continue funding America's nearly five-year occupation of Iraq. Freedom's Watch filed papers on Sept. 17 to lobby lawmakers, as noted this week by CQ Moneyline, a campaign fundraising and political advocacy tracking service. The group says it plans to reach out to members of both parties on a variety of issues, including troop funding and "winning the war on terror." "We won't narrow our scope in terms of who we're going to be talking to," Matt David, a spokesman for the group, tells RAW STORY . The lobbying disclosure form lists three Freedom's Watch officials, who are joining the pro-war lobbying effort, including Bradley Blakeman, a former deputy assistant to President Bush, and David, a former Bush-Cheney campaign aide. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer is a founding board member of Freedom's Watch, although he is not listed as a registered lobbyist. David says Fleischer won't be involved in the lobbying effort, and the group will not be coordinating its actions with the Bush administration. "By law we're not allowed to coordinate with the White House, so we are following the law," he said in an interview Friday. "We are not coordinating with the White House." As RAW STORY reported last month, Freedom's Watch appears to be part of a revolving door between the White House and outside public relations groups trying to bolster support for the unpopular occupation of Iraq. David said Freedom's Watch plans to announce an expansion of its advocacy efforts to include issues beyond the war and hopes to become a force in Washington. "This is an organization with the goal to be a perpetual operation for years and years to come," he said. In August, Freedom's Watch began a $15 million ad campaign in 20 states urging members of Congress to stay the course in Iraq. Those ads, which aired just before Gen. David Petraeus's progress report on the "surge" in Iraq, conflated the Iraq invasion and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, despite the fact that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the plot to fell the World Trade Center. Just this month, Freedom's Watch purchased newspaper ads in vulnerable Democrats' districts, although the ads didn't seem to shake their targets. "If people want to advertise that he's advocating a position different than President Bush, we welcome that,"a spokesman for Rep. Harry Mitchell, an Arizona Democrat whose constituents saw the Freedom's Watch ad in the Arizona Republic, told the Huffington Post's Michael Roston. It is unclear whether the highly emotional ads helped sway any votes, although Congress has continually failed to force a change of course in Iraq. Whether such arguments will be just as convincing when presented in person remains to be seen.
Recently I have noticed a great increase in questions having to do media and which should be used in the askers particular situation.I thought I would put some effort into creating a "Guide" of sorts that may possibly be of some help to people with filter media questions, especially those who are somewhat new to the hobby or are just breaking into the DIY scene.I figured I would post many of the frequently used (or asked about) medias along with a few of the main upsides and downsides of said media.If anybody sees a commonly used media that I left out or just one that fits the guide feel free to add,although preferably in roughly the same format as to emphasize simplicity and improve the overall flow of the "Media Guide".with that said,let us begin withSurface area/cu.ft.:120Upsides: A fairly easily obtained and inexpensive material suitable for both bio-media as well as a pre-filter media.Often available in bulk.Downsidesn the low side as far as surface area, compresses somewhat over time.Overall: Excellent choice for bio-media in a sump with no lack of space.I had mine stacked about 12" high and the compressed somewhat over about a years time...perhaps flipping them occasionally can prevent this.Surface area/cu.ft.: roughly 75-175 depending on porousnessUpsides: An excellent all around choice of media in most applications.Technically you could run sponges or foam of varying porousness in your entire sump.Holds up well under "Rinse and re-use" conditions.Downsides: Clogs.not the highest in terms of surface area.If you have a rather large bio-load or somewhat of a lack of space you may want to look into media with a higher surface area.Rather pricey if needed in large quantity as well, IMHOOverall:A good pre-filter or bio-media however frequent rinsing will be needed if you are using this as your primary source of mechanical filtrationSurface area/cu.ft.:100Upsides:Rather inexpensive.descent micro-polisher.Downsides:Clogs easy.Not as porous as one would think,so water doesn't flow well through the center....although giving them a few good pokes with a kitchen knife works wonders.I am told they break down over time,although I have seen them successfully used in a sump for around 8 months.Overall:Not the best choice for either mechanical or biological but can be used until a better media is obtained.Surface area/cu.ft.:370Upsides: Whats not to love?Fairly high surface area, clog resistance and an easily stackable shape make these an all time favorite for experienced aquarists everywhere.Not to mention they are cheap as hell.Downsides:If your bio-load is huge yet your sump is less than massive, you will still most likely eventually find yourself looking to add some media with a higher surface area.Overall:Best bang for your buck as far as bio-mediaSurface area/cu.ft.:150-200Upsides:Excellent flow rate through media, among the best stacking medias in the "Guide" allow for maximum media coverage in tight spaces.Good as a "filler" media tucked here and there to fill in empty spaces in the sump.Downsides:Once again with a massive bio-load or very little space to work with you may find yourself wanting a smaller media with a higher surface area.Overall:Much the same as pot scubbies with some surface area sacrificed for far greater stackability.Surface area/cu.ft.:175-225Upside:Good flow rate,stackable,fair surface area.Downsides:Same as scourers.Overall: Much the same as the scourers but usually tighter woven providing more surface area with a slight reduction in flow rate.Surface area/cu.ft.: 75Upsides:free if you have a girlfriend (they always keep extra....)Downsides:Not pretty if your girlfriend ever finds out where her body scrubbers went.also they compress,have a low surface area and can sometimes contain perfumes built right into the plastic/nylon.Overall:Best used to soap up naked ladies.Surface area/cu.ft.:?Upsides:Great mechanical filtration,extremely cheap when purchased in bulk.Can be rinsed and reused.Can also be purchased in pads.Cheap at the LFS and 5 times cheaper at a fabric store.Downsides:Clogs fairly quickly.Fibers can be (and often are) found tangled on your impellor or floating in your tank.Overall:The mechanical counterpart to pot scrubbies.Cheap,easy to maintain,and reusable.Surface area/cu.ft.:NAUpsides:Unless your tank is super messy you can often get away with having a filter sock or two as your sumps primary source of mechanical filtration,freeing up valuable space for more bio-media.Downsides:If your tank is super messy these will clog and mess with your flow rate somewhat.Overall:Not a bad addition to a sump with proper maintenance.Surface area/cu.ft.: NAUpsides:Excellent for last stage mechanical filtration.Acts as a "micro polishing pad" for your sump.Downsides:Clogs extremely easy unless the water goes through several stages of mech filtration before going through the felt.Also the felt is often dyed (even the white felt is often dyed that color) so a bit of searching or a lot of rinsing is required.Overall:Often unnecessary yet hard to beat as a micro polisher for you tank.Surface area/cu.ft. NAUpsides:Easily obtained,often best choice for mech filtration.Varying levels of porousness for further customization of mechanical filtration.Downsides:Somewhat pricey.Not often sold in what I would consider "bulk"Overallrobably the most frequently used mechanical medias available.Most often what people choose to put in their drip trays.Surface area/cu.ft.:60-175Upsidesoes not compress.Good for use as a permanent mech filtration pad that can be rinsed and reused.Sold in bulk.Buoyant, otherwise much the same as a scouring pad such as scotch brite.Downsides:Expensive,Buoyant,Low surface area per cu.ft. means alot would be needed for bio.Overall:Basically a large scouring padSurface area/cu.ft.:ALOT (Varies)Upsides:most surface area in the smallest space possible is what cannister media is all about.If you have a very large bio-load than a sump full of pot scrubbies may not cut it,which is where the cannister bio-media comes in handy.DownsidesriceyOverall:I'm sure it would be great if we all had the money to fill our sump with cannister bio-media like cell pore and the like but for those of us who don't defecate money I suggest just buying a container at a time and tossing it in your sump,eventually youll have quite a bit.My main chamber in my sump is filled with scrubbies however I toss in a container of cannister media whenever I have a few extra dollars (cell-pore,eheim pro,biomax,etc.) and I am slowly but surely filling my third chamber.Surface area/cu.ft.:100-175Upsides:fair surface area,shaped for maximum aeration,can be purchased in bulk,often for a fair price if shopped for online.One of the best things you can put in the wet/dry section of your sump.Downsides:can be pricey if your too lazy to shop around.I also hear Pot Scrubbies work at least as well as bio-balls in the wet/dry chamber,though I have not personally confirmed this.Effectiveness supposedly greatly diminished when submerged.Overall:The media most people use in the wet/dry section of their sumps, followed by scrubbies in a close second.Surface area/cu.ft.:250Upsides:Good surface area.Sold in Bulk.Downsides:Can become somewhat compressed over time, countered by the occasional "fluffing".Overall:Used much the same as you would pot scrubbies or bioballs, either in the wet/dry or fully submerged.Surface area/cu.ft.:15-25Upsides:very easily obtained and rather inexpensive.Good filler in a sump on a tank with a light bioloadDownsides:Very low surface area really.If pores get clogged than you might as well just drop a stone in your tank for biomedia.Overall:Not the best choice for biomedia.Even If you were to keep the pores of the rock very clean your sump would still have to be about the same size as the tank your filtering.For those who still insist on using lava rock I might suggest breaking it up with a hammer and putting it in a media bag.Surface area/cu.ft.:Upsides:Supposedly house a super concentrated bacteria colony.Wet/Dry design.Downsides:Very high Evaporation.Somewhat of a price factor involved.Overall:Used with succes on smaller HOB's but not widely used in conjunction with sumps (unless you have a tidepool sump).Thought about adding one to my sump.Upside:eat nitrates.Downside:Usually need special lighting.Not always room for a full size refugium,and often not enough space in your sump for a "mini-refugium"Overall:I fairly good idea.I want to put a refugium on my sump but have not decided how exactly to go about doing so.These are the primary choices for filter media that we as aquarists have available to us,and I hope this "Guide" is of some help to many an aquarist who are scratching their head,looking at that empty chamber on your filter and wondering what to place there.CHARLOTTE, N.C. — At 6-foot-6, 318 pounds, Andrew Norwell is a difficult person to miss.
2 We don’t exactly know what happens to matter when falling into a black hole though we can be sure that only due to the enormous gravitational force our civilisation ends right there. And so it is that Earth too could be vulnerable. Whyever not? We are, at our ‘cor e’ (!) simply a part of ‘space’. A planet; a starry spec ‘out there’. And if any other star can be swallowed then it would be both complacent and indeed illogical to assume that the A black hole visiting and swallowing Earth Earth is beyond such a fate. Imagine CERN, the particle accelerator, simulating the origins of the Earth: the ‘big bang’. Well, it has been legitimately speculated that a strong gravitational force could thereby be generated and in turn, tear apart the very fabric of the Earth’s stability. In short: we could create our own ‘black hole’ and that would swallow us up. Discovery has a price and that price could be an apocalypse! The str ong gravitational force would tear apart the planet for sure, so even without knowing what happens to matter beyond the Event Horiz on of the black hole, we can be sure that’s the end of our world as we know it. 1
3 A gamma ray burst occurs when a massive star dies and collapses, causing a huge explosion known as a supernova. The r emnant of this supernova is often a neutron star, quark star or black hole. During the supernova a narrow beam of intense radiation known as a gamma-ray burst is sometimes released from either pole of the star. A gamma-ray burst is incredibly powerful, typically releasing more energy in seconds than Gamma ray burst reaching Earth the sun will in its 10 billion-year lifetime. A planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder, astronomers say. In the realm of science ﬁction, gamma rays are our friends rather than foes. Note that the heroic and altruistic Dr. Bruce Banner researches the things for the beneﬁt of mankind; his expertise on the subject helping to perfect a super- soldier serum and repel an alien invasion. Unfortunately, it also turns him into a giant raging monster known as the HULK. But just think of the fun we all have in watching ‘HULK SMASH!’. Empirical, scientiﬁc proofs are available, Marvel comic books, tv series, cartoon shows and of course the recent A vengers Assemble and forthcoming Age of Ultron. 2
4 Ok. This was AL W A YS going to be a long shot. But it IS possible. Not probable, granted. But possible. Y ou cannot rule it out. Consider this: SOMEWHERE in our dense universe, there is at least one planet CAP ABLE of sustaining life in a similar capacity to that of Earth. Who is to say that the spark did not ignite? We may indeed have alien counterparts. Granted, they may have chosen NO T to contact us! Perhaps they took one look at the Earth’s aesthetic from space: pollution; ozone layer; oceans expanding and ice caps melting and thought ‘sod this: back to our leader!’. IE if we seem primitive and destructive to a SUPERIOR species, then WHY would they even ventur e into OUR territory? W ould YOU settle in an uninhabitable Alien invasion home? No. Neither would aliens. The logical alt ernative is that the alien life forms in question are LESS advanced than we. Ther efore, they would hav e neither means nor inclination to contact the Earth. T his is a prominent concern in science ﬁction: note that Star T rek often speaks of ‘‘pre industrial civilisations’, rather than having EVERY star and system populated by God like beings (Q /Khan et al are not always the focus; note Star T rek Generations and Insurrection both feature primitive communities). That said, we just don’t know yet. T he sheer mathematics that divide us in light years could prevent a communication of any meaningful nature to intercept or pr event the dark day of an alien war. Indeed, the way the makers of the inevitable Independence Day sequel (20 years after the original was a box ofﬁce hit) explained the del ay in those terms: ‘twenty years could be ﬁve minutes to an alien race’ (relativity, basically). If these are indeed hostile aliens, what is the greatest weapon in warfare? SURPRISE! So don’t rule out an attack one day, as you go about your daily business..( cf: War of the Worlds) or even just an outbreak of a virus carried by one of OUR space explorers (remember, readers: a ‘virus’ IS an intelligent life form..and they do exist in space). ‘In space, no-one can hear you cough’ . 3
5 Don’t let the title scare you away. Let us explain.. ‘The Standar d Model’, that is our best model of the universe so far, says that the vacuum is not devoid of matter. Instead, it teems with particles and antiparticles that pop into exist ence and run into one another and annihilate themselves. T his quantum mechanic process violates no laws of physics, provided the particles don’t live longer than a ﬂeeting instant. The Standar d Model also says that for the vacuum of empty space to be stable, we should be living at a minimum of potential energy. It is lik e living at the bottom of a valley Vacuum instability bordered by hills! And the value of the Higgs potential would be lowest point of the valley. BUT our Universe might end if our valley really is not the lowest one around. T he shape of the Higgs potential is determined precisely by the Higgs mass. The observ ed 126 GeV mass seems to imply the universe does not exist in the lowest possible energy state. It is sort of like being in a valley whose ﬂoor is higher than that of an adjoining valley. If we did not know that a deep valley was on the other side of the hill, we would think we were at the lowest level we could be. If we somehow managed to get to the other side, however, we could fall much lower. This situation would normally not pose a problem, as we could not travel between valleys, ex cept in quantum mechanics, which allows particles to tunnel through hills unpredictably. As a result, in the future our Universe could spontaneously and randomly tunnel through to the deeper one, with potentially catastrophic consequences. 4
